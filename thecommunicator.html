							<p>Six Years Ago...</p>

							<p>“Albert Heint, you worthless piece of shit!” </p>

                            <p>Standing before an irate OA Commander, a trim, if not lanky ensign stood with his eyes fixed on a small vent attached to a bulkhead directly in front of his eyes. He did not dare to turn his gaze from that spot. Already his cheek was being pelted with spit and phlem from the officer yelling at his face. He did not want to experience someone’s saliva watering his dry and bloodshot eyes. The verbal tirade continued. </p>
                            
                            <p>“I have never seen such a wasted uniform in my 35 years of service. Your mother should have done us all a service and ejected you out of the closest airlock when you were born. You are that incompetent! Isn’t that right soldier?”</p>

                            <p>Albert let his eyes dart to the Commander. His bushy mustache was dripping the same wet substance that was coming from his mouth and this was the first time Albert noticed that the spittle was discolored. It was a mixture of reds and browns mashed by whatever substance the Commander was chewing in the side of his cheek. Albert instinctively winced from the realization of what was falling down his face. </p>

                            <p>He quickly stiffened and addressed the wall, “Sir, I am.”</p>

                            <p>“You are what, Heint?” The Commander lowered his voice and stepped even closer. Albert could feel the warm wet breath of the Aegis officer against his skin and whispering in Albert’s ear, “You’re a shit-eating maggot? Say those words, Ensign. Those exact words.” As Albert opened his mouth ready to utter those words, the cabin door slid open and another OA officer stepped in. The Commander begrudgingly and slowly stepped back and straightened his posture to address his superior. </p>

                            <p>Albert heard the officer’s footsteps first. It wasn’t the booted clunking of a seasoned soldier. It was the unmistakable click of a woman’s heel as it hit the metal grating of the ship’s floor. The woman was busy with her focus consumed by the information coming through on her tablet. She traversed the room in silence. She headed straight towards a simple table and chairs on the the far side of the cabin. As she took a seat, she finally threw a comment out to the room. “Thank you Commander Keats. If I need someone to yell at the Ensign some more, I’ll be sure to send for you.”</p>

                            <p>Keats, looked at Albert one last time, and a sinister smile crept up his mouth sending shivers down Albert’s spine. Then the officer clicked his boots and proceeded to exit the room without another word. </p>

                            <p>“Have a seat Mr. Heint.” Her voice was cold, biting. As Albert sat down across from the female officer. Everything about her told a story about discipline, duty, and a grim adherence to law. “I am Rank Commander Shepard. I understand from talking to your fellow crew members that you prefer, Al. Is that correct?”</p>

                            <p>“Yes, Ma’am.” </p>

                            <p>“Albert, I guess I just really have one question for you.” There was a long pause in between her questions as she looked up from her pad and stared into Al’s eyes. The silence was eroding any confidence that he had left. “Why would you throw a, well let’s be honest, a mediocre service record down the drain?”</p>

                            <p>“Ma’am?” In all the time that Albert had spent being hauled out of his communications post, yelled at, belittled he still did not know what had gone wrong. Best he could managed this was due to the ship wide alarm that went out a few hours back and there was a faint sound of an explosion or something to that matter. But all Albert ever does is maintain the authentication servers aboard the ship. An extremely uninteresting post, but one that guaranteed a safe living. </p>

                            <p>“You do know what the punishment of treason is, Albert?”</p>

                            <p>“Wha…I…I would never.”</p>

                            <p>Shepard stared at Albert for an eternity. Her expression was granite. Unmoving. Albert was stammering and pleading for explanation, sympathy, acquittal. All the while, Shepard burrowed her gaze deeper into Al’s soul. Finally, after seeing all she needed to, she slid her tablet down the table into Albert’s lap. “At 03:45 multiple requests were sent through the system. Requests that breached security functions designed to combat malicious attacks.” </p>

                            <p>“I…I didn’t see any of these come through.”</p>

                            <p>“That’s because you initiated them.”</p>

                            <p>“What? No! I would never.”</p>

                            <p>“All requests were submitted by your signature and at your station. Tell me again you’re innocent.”</p>

                            <p>“I am. I need this posting, I…wait you said 03:45? I wasn’t even at my station. I had to relieve myself. I had to pee. I was peeing!” Albert blurted out without any hint of decorum or self-respect. Shepard for the first time since entering let the faintest crack in her unflinching demeanor show. Her eyebrows flinched at Albert’s juvenile stupidity. She had dressed down commanders and section leaders a hundred times over in her work, but she never had the person sitting across from her be this puerile. Saying nothing she stood up and walked out the door.</p>

                            <p>Albert was lost for what had just happened. Did he convince her? Was she going to let him free? Was she coming back with Keats to spit in his face again? The questions were swirling through his mind until he noticed that Shepard had left her tablet with him. He quickly went to work bypassing the security lock that was placed on the hardware and searched through the ship’s confidential logs to see just what had happened. Albert read has fast as he could before someone came back and shove him out an airlock. He once heard stories about what happened to those who were suspected of treason against the OA. Even though the Aegis was the pillar of justice in the galaxy, accidents happen and they seem to happen to those that work against the grain. </p>

                            <p>Albert skimmed the files and found a log entry by a Sub Commander Lotik. It recounted an ambush in the applied research laboratory in the ships below decks near the hanger bays. Outlaw or Mercenary soldiers gained entry into the secure zone and escaped with an experimental space ship that was near final completion. The intruders also contaminated all data regarding the ship and all schematics off the OA servers. All the servers. A complete breakdown and lost of property would be a horrible embarrassment for the military. “Maybe,” thought Al, “I could use this to my advantage.” Before he could flesh out his strategy however, the door slid open once again and Rank Commander Shepard entered the room. As the door closed behind her, he saw General Oberdine Casus staring the most hateful look that Albert had ever seen. It made Al shrink in his chair as if only his gaze could liquify Albert’s bones. </p>

                            <p>Shepard once again traversed the length of the room to her chair and sat down with a maddening silence. “Well, Albert. Looks like you are getting a promotion.” Shepard’s voice was monotone, unreadable. Al couldn’t figure out if she was lying or if she had indeed corroborated his story.</p>

                            <p>“…Thank you, Ma’am.”</p>

                            <p>“Hrm. Yes. About has much as I expected.” Shepard sighed and disgustedly shrugged off the incompetence of the junior officer. “What you told me was verified. There was a proxy virus imbedded within the authentications that masked the user's real location.” With that explanation, Shepard got back up and proceeded for the door. </p>

                            <p>The relief was overwhelming for Al. In his euphoric haze he almost forgot what Shepard had said first. “Rank Commander, what rank am I to be promoted?”</p>

                            <p>Shepard stopped mid stride and turned back to Albert and with the same malicious smile he saw on the face of Commander Keats, Rank Commander Shepard told Albert, “Communicator, 3rd Class.” Inside Albert was bursting with excitement. Communicators process all intelligence coming in and out of the OA ships and stations. He is about to see the most classified data in all the Aegis Assembly. “Congratulations, Albert. You ship out to your new posting in The Span tomorrow.” Shepard waited just a moment before leaving the room to watch the color drain from Albert’s face.</p>

							<p>Present Day...</p>
							
							<p>The Starless Span housed no habitable planets. No planets at all. No stars. Not one nebula or spec of space dust. It was a wasteland. A barren void that reflected out all light from the closest sun. Once you enter the Span all ship instruments ceased their functionality. You were running truly blind. There was a time in the galactic history that this phenomena was the edge of the cosmos. Since then, there was found to be three Spans that separated Homage into its three Vitale Arms. Between Haven and Heath after many deaths and lost vessels, a pathway between the two Arms was charted, and with that came a new section of the galaxy to explore. </p>

							<p>Hanging there, suspended in the nothingness of the Span was an OA Relay Station. A communication hub that bridged the two Arms of the galaxy. The station itself was not an impressive structure. The metal plating of the hull was beginning to breakdown. The station's systems were growing old and outdated. Little paid attention to the Relay anymore. Any important information was sent by ship incase any data pirates were laying in wait. It was for all intent and purpose a symbol of ineffectual aging. Much like its sole inhabitant. </p>

							<p>“Neuroglyph sequence recognized. Starting verification…” </p>

							<p>The computer systems awoke with a buzz of clatter and calculations. Lights flickered on from their hibernating state. Across the computer screen numbers sprinted through key codes and system diagnostics.  “Verification authenticated. Starting Neural Pathway downloads…” From his spirit induced slumber a ragged man stirred from his dreams of fortune and women. Peering through one of his half opened eyes, his dazed state caught the commands of the computer sputtering through code on a cracked and rusted display. Breaking through the haze the realization of what was happening bounced around his head like a wrecking ball.</p>

							<p>His eyes darted around the room.  Looking console to console, he tried to catch up to the moment.  As he attempted to move, his oversized gut barred him from standing at attention. After a few tries he finally hoisted himself out of his chair and began frantically typing away on the computer’s keyboard.</p>

							<p>"Well, well my little minx what do you have for me today?" The man wiped the drool from his mouth with a stained jacket sleeve. The whole appearance of the man more than pacified even the casual observer who had a notion of how a deep space communications Relay Station would affect the lone inhabitant. Civility and good manners were pointless in the vast reaches of the Starless Span. Communicators would go for months without seeing another human being. OA Starships avoided entering the Span except to deliver goods and pick up whatever coded messages the communicators were able to decipher from the comm relays.</p>

							<p>Lights danced across the communicator's eyes as he watched the lines of data fill up the screen. "Oh, you've been a very busy lady, haven't you? Let's see if I can find out where you are trying to go." With a few more clicks of his machine, the portly man's eyes grew wide. "This is too good to be true." With an excitement and energy that the man had never shown since arriving on the station six years prior. He jumped out of his chair and hurried as fast has his swollen legs could carry him to his personal computer. "You are going to be my ticket out of here my little friend. Whoever you are, you are going to make me rich. They all said that Albert Heint was never going to amount to anything. We will show them, won't we my little bodiless friend? Everyone will be lining up for sectors to try and take a peek at your memory files. We are going to make each other rich." As soon as he could he slouched back down in his chair and went to work at the task on hand. He began downloading the data to his own secure memory core. Soon the data stream began its automated synchronizing process onto Albert's server. </p>

							<p>The Communicator leaned back against the alloy composite support of the chair with a smile on his face and closed his eyes as he dreamed about his good fortune and the endless wealth that was sure to materialize. He only needed to arrange passage off of the array. The next scheduled deliver ship wasn't due to arrive for eight months. Albert knew he could not hold up on this festering metal tomb now that an endless sea of money and the depraved pleasures of the galaxy were so close. He needed to lure a ship into the Span.  But with what? He couldn't tell them about his illustrious find. Any smuggler worth his mettle would sooner kill him and take the information for themselves. Certainly any military ship would confiscate everything on the array and leave him destitute. He needed a plan.  A well thought through reason for abandoning his duty and post. This might take a while. As Albert's mind trailed off in flights of fancy and what was to be. In the starless void outside the walls of the station, Albert's golden ticket was fast approaching.</p>

							<p>Miles out from the station, a small interstellar cruiser was piercing through space.  None of its running lights were visible; it made no sound as the engines were running quiet. Only the outline of the craft was determinable in the shifting darkness. The flying boat didn't want to be found. That was the only reason to be sailing through the abyss blind. It has been out there for a time avoiding detection sneaking across the span. Silently the ship shifted its heading and made a dash towards the communications array.</p>

							<p>A small light on one of the side consoles of the main communicator terminal beside Albert illuminated bright red. The short range sensors of the array detected the inbound cruiser. Within moments the ship would begin to dock on the starboard hatch. Albert, if he was even conscience of the alert could be running a detection search against the vessel and determine if he should power up the main battery and defend himself against the potential intruder. The Order of the Aegis made sure that its secrets, even if they insignificant, were well guarded. Amenities notwithstanding, the small station could hold off anything short of a full battlement of ships for at least a few days until a regiment could be dispatched. Albert however was lost in his debotchery. He only looked up from his personal terminal when the station physically rumbled as the cruiser's landing hatched secured against the station.</p>

							<p>Panic rushed through Albert's veins as all his plans seemed to be sifting through his fingers like sand. His fiction was not ready for distribution. The finely crafted lies would not hold up to the scrutiny of interrogation. He would be found out, his coveted prize taken from him. Albert knew the limitations of his body and any physical confrontation his muscles would fold to the pressure of a trained operative. He was running out of time.  Albert cursed himself for not setting the automated security system when he left his chair at the stations main console, but he could not dwell on his stupidity. Soon whomever was docking with his station would force themselves past the airlock override systems. While the OA afforded the luxuries of four main cannons on each of its relay stations, it did not bother with the internal security systems for small combat intrusions. There wasn't much point. A system dump of the relay's memory core as a last resort would be implemented by the communicator and the station would be rendered useless to the intruders. At that point the life of the communicator would cease being significant to the OA, and the fate of the man would be left up to the Divines to save.</p>

							<p>The hatch of the lower airlock was blown open and in walked three armored figures. </p>
