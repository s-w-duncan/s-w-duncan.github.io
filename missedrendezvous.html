                            <p>Tems Queensfel held her breath as she keyed in the last sequence of code. This was it. Months of planning came down to trusting a thief and a liar. One wrong symbol, one transposed digit and the whole Order of the Aegis military would be alerted to her location. Imprisonment certain, and death, well that was a strong possibility. She stood looking at the monitor, her finger hovering over the final keystroke. As everything around Tems came to a halt and time seemed to stop, the rest of space continued to orbit around her.</p>

                            <p>Queensfel was tethered against an orbiting satellite array sixteen kilometers above a brilliant blue and white hued moon. The system’s sun reflecting off the moon made everything look incandescent. As the satellite revolved around its axis Tems traveled with it. Every minute she would be flooded with the breathtaking shimmer of a moon at the peak of its beauty. </p>
                            
                            <p>Within her armored space suit; however, the scene was lost on Tems. The internal display of her helmet kept her appraised of a number of different systems working at all times when in the gravity well of space. Health vitals, oxygen reserves, spacial location coordinates all flooded the display. All Tems could see though was the final strain of proprietary Aegis computer code. Her heart rate quickened at the thought about pushing the final input. </p>

                            <p>A small tone beeped within her ear as the suit’s notification system alerted Tems to an incoming communication. “Are you seeing this view!” The woman’s voice echoed through the com link and bounced around Tems brain as if kicking her against a wall. </p>

                            <p>“By the Divines, Helena!” Tems choked back. “Do you realize where I am with this?”</p>

                            <p>“Eesh! Sorry, Tems. But you have to admire the locations where the OA build their listening posts.” Helena was younger than Tems, and the exuberance of youth was one of the endearing qualities of the girl. As well as her technical engineering mastery.</p>

                            <p>"Aren’t you worried that the Order of the Aegis might be picking up on our little conversation?”</p>

                            <p>“Please! I’ve got our channel wrapped around so many relay signals, it would take them months to unscramble it all.” Helena sat back against the back of her chair as she put back a pair of heavily modified binoculars to her eyes. “You know, you cut quite the dashing figure spinning around on that satellite, Tems.”</p>

                            <p>“I’ll have to tell Vale that he has some competition when we get back to the Quetzalcoatl.”</p>

                            <p>"Indignantly Helena shot back, “Like he would stand a chance against me, if I was serious about it, that is.”</p>

                            <p>“Like you could handle me!” Tems breathed a little easier. Despite Helena’s brashness, it does help to cut the tension in times like these. “Alright, shut up, Solt. I’m ready to finish this. Keep your eyes plastered on those Aegis communications and not my finely shaped metal polymer encased ass.”</p>

                            <p>“You got it, boss.”</p>

                            <p>“That data broker better have been right about this authentication key or I am going to rip out his spleen and send it to his mother.” With a final keystroke Tems initiated the code, and waited as the system verified the cipher. </p>

                            <p>‘…'</p>

                            <p>‘…'</p>

                            <p>‘…Credentials verified. Input command pathway.’</p>

                            <p>Tems closed her eyes and exhaled a long deep breath. She had breached the Aegis control pathways. They were in the OA’s system root menu. From here the real work began. “I’m in Helena. Do you see anything on any of the OA’s com lines?”</p>

                            <p>“So far so good, T. Are you sure Casus’ files are even on this node?”</p>

                            <p>“We have to get lucky one of these times. By the time it gets to the main hub, the files are already scrubbed clean from the system. The bastard is clever. He knows how these systems work just as well as you do, Helena.” Tems was sifting through the drives. The words were coming out as a reflex, not really paying any attention to what she was saying.</p>

                            <p>“Is that some kind of slight, T? You haven’t told any of the others have you?”</p>

                            <p>“What?” Tems looked up from the screen and looked into the blackened space trying to see their ship. All she could see was distant stars. The ship was thousands of kilometers away, hidden from he array’s sensors. “Sorry, Helena. I didn’t mean it that way. Of course not. Although you should tell them at some point, but it’s not my place to say anything.”</p>

                            <p>“I know. I just don’t want to open up that very tangled can of worms.” Helena was caught up in her own head thinking about all the possibilities that could happen if she told the rest of the crew. A small benign string of outgoing data passed her notice. “I should. I will, T. When we get back. I’ll talk to the Captain.”</p>

                            <p>Tems was back to her screen checking file pathways, decoding military communications, looking for the specific signature held within the data processing within the array. “Suit yourself, your funeral.”</p>

                            <p>“Hey you just said I should tell him!” Helena responded back. All Tems could do was smirk underneath her pressurized helmet. That smile was notorious. Many men and quite a few women have fallen in love with that smile over the years. “I hate you.”</p>

                            <p>The two went back to their work. Over the next few solar cycles, they both stayed off the com link until a half corrupted file extension crossed Tems' eyes. “I think I found something.”</p>

                            <p>“What is it?”</p>

                            <p>“I’m not sure.” Tems tried to pull up the file and see the contents, but the contents were highly erratic. Garbled almost beyond recognition, but sophistically encrypted. Then she saw it. The file had a personal identifier buried within the chaos. Oberdine Casus. “There’s a audio file.” Tems pulled up the recording and patched it into Helena’s com link. </p>

							<p>Tems and Helena heard a man’s voice appearing to be talking with someone through a long distance substraight link. The recording cut in and out, “…waiting for you…wipe out…nomadic colony…no survivors…” Both the women could not pick out much of the man’s conversation outside of those words, nor the identity of the man speaking them. There was a long pause in the recording until another man’s voice came through. “Don’t worry old friend, it will be dealt with.”</p>
							
							<p>“Casus…” Helena’s voice trailed off. “Tems, is that what-“</p>

							<p>“Yeah, Helena. I think so.” </p>

							<p>“I think we need to get back to the Quetzalcoatl, T.”</p>

							<p>“There might be more. I need to tear apart this satellite, find everything.”</p>

							<p>“I don’t think that’s a good idea, we’ve been out here for-“ Just then alarms blared through the ship’s cockpit. “Oh, no. Tems! Get outta there!”</p>

							<p>“Not yet. I need more time.” Tems kept searching through the satellite’s mainframe for more.</p>

							<p>“It’s the OA. They found us.”</p>

							<p>Out of the corner of Tems’ eye she saw a massive blur shoot across space. Appearing in an instant, a heavy Aegis destroyer blotted out the distant stars. On the starboard section of the hull, the letters, O.A. LEVIATHAN, were scrawled across.</p>

							<p>“Shit! Helena, it’s the Leviathan. Get out of here, now!”</p>

							<p>“I’m not leaving you here. I’m coming to get you.”</p>

							<p>“No, you need to get back to the Quetzalcoatl. Give them the file and track down who sent it.”</p>

							<p>“I can get to you before they know I’m here!”</p>

							<p>“Tems! Their forward battery is about to-“ Before Helena could finish, a flash of intense heat blasted out of one of the Leviathan’s cannons. It screamed through the silent space. Queensfel had only seconds to untether herself from the satellite and activate her suit’s propulsion jets. The satellite exploded under Tems’ feet. The shockwave surged in all directions, bursting against Tems’ pressurized suit.  She screamed out as the blast reverberated within her body. Her armor began to crack, warning lights and sounds from the suit’s failsafes echoed in her skull. “Tems!”</p>

                            <p>Helena felt a violent convulsion within her gut when she saw Tems careening through space. She was about to fire the engines of her two cabin vessel and blast through the Leviathan to try and save her when a voice came through the cockpit. </p>
                            
                            <p>“Don’t do it, Helena. Please. Get back home. Tell Vale…tell him I’m sorry I missed our date.”</p>

                            <p>The voice cut out. The static dulled out all other sounds blaring through the small compartment. Helena didn’t remember what happened next. She only knew that her stardrive activated and shot the ship into the outer reaches of Hearth’s Vitale Arm. Past OA patrolled space and toward a rendezvous she didn’t know how to face.</p>
