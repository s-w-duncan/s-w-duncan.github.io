							<p>The steady rhythmic droning of the metal wheels clanking against the railway stirred Anhiesal from his slumber.  Dazed, he slowly opened his eyes and when his eyesight cleared he shoot up in his chair in alarm and confusion.  As his breathing and heartbeat increased he started to panic.  Clutching onto the soft cushion of the armrest fear was setting in, and Anhiesal found his vision beginning to blur and a sharp pain in his head leading him to fall back into an unconscious silence.  He fought to regain his senses, and as the fog began to clear he managed to form a coherent thought.  Where am I?</p>

                            <p>Anhiesal Tumel looked around the cabin of what seemed to be an early model passenger car.  But this rail car was in pristine condition. The wooden slates of the ceiling and floor were polished and did not look like they have ever been stepped on.  The window treatments were a deep purple velvet material and lined the whole interior.  Anhiesal found himself in the back corner of the rail car sitting in a single wingback chair looking out to the rest of the booths, chairs, and small serving tables that flanked the middle isle that led to the other train cars.  A sinking feeling began to set into Anhiesal's stomach.  He saw no one else in the cabin with him.  He was alone.</p>
                            
                            <p>He got up from his chair and turned to peer out the window to find out where he was.  The sun was beaming into the cabin.  As Anhiesal strained his eyes to look past the glare, all he saw was a sky filled with whites, blues, and yellow hues that danced past the window.  Below he could see the wooden slates of the railroad passing by, but nothing else save for a dense mist that clouded the ground beneath the train.  Not finding any answers from outside Anhiesal ran his fingers through his slicked back straight black hair trying to gather his thoughts.  His attention came back to the cabin car.  Taking a few steps towards the front of the train, he glanced between chairs and booths tying to find some bit of information.</p>

                            <p>The door at the front of the car flew open, and a heavy set man in a grey maitre d'h√¥tel uniform stood in the doorway.  As he stepped onto the cabin floor his mouth opened wide in an inviting smile as he looked around the empty cabin.  As if in his own world the man glanced right passed Anhiesal and set his eyes on the empty seat beside the door. </p>

                            <p>"Ticket please, sir?" The man asked an empty seat. As Anhiesal looked at the attendant he was astonished to see a ticket appear in his hand. He quickly looked back and in the empty chair was now an old lady in a blue sweater and skirt. Her hair and jewelry were finely crafted as if she was ready for a night at the theater.</p>

                            <p>"Where am I?" Anhiesal was on the edge of frantic. He was starting to think he was losing his mind. The old lady did not notice the bewildering bellows of the young man standing behind her.</p>

                            <p>All she spoke was a question to the attendant, "How long until we reach the station?"</p>

                            <p>"Oh, not long at all, Ma'am." With another smile the portly man turned to the other side of the cabin to take more tickets from a car now full of passengers.</p>

                            <p>"Can any of you hear me!" Anhiesal was screaming.</p>

                            <p>The whole cabin of eyes shifted instantly to the hysterical man. A deftly silence fell upon the car. Even the rhythmic metal clanking of the track seemed to diminish. Anhiesal felt the blood rush away from his extremities and felt very cold, and very scared.</p>

                            <p>"Sir," the attendant," please take your seat, sir. I will be with you shorty." Anhiesal could do nothing more than to take his advice. Returning to his seat, Anhiesal noticed that he had a companion jointing him the seat next to the one he awoke from. A middle aged man, short curly hair that had almost all but turned grey. Dressed in a relatively low quality wool suit. The metal frame of his glasses were beginning to rust. He looked straight ahead and paid Anhiesal no mind. Sitting in his chair, Anhiesal looked at the man and back to the front of the car where the attendant was still hard at work.</p>

                            <p>Looking back at his neighbor, he decided to risk a question, "Excuse me, do you know where we are going?" The man did not respond, did not look over at Anhiesal, all he did was smile. This only added to the growing realization that Anhiesal was in danger here. But from what he did not quite know yet. He was surround by very respectful, very nicely dressed individuals.</p>

                            <p>Anhiesal forced himself to breathe and slow his quickening heartbeat. "Think Anhi! What was the last thing you remember before the train?" He was grabbing at his hair trying to dig out the information from his head. "I can't remember. Why can't I remember?" He closed his eyes.</p>

                            <p>When he reopened them, his head was resting comfortably against the cushioned chair. It was only a moments blink, but Anhiesal felt all of the stress that was building up inside was just gone. As if it was never there, as if he never felt it in the first place. This was a truly comforting feeling and Anhiesal sunk back into the cabin chair, and looked ahead and a slight smile crossed his face. He was glad. No, glad wasn't the word to describe his peacefulness. He couldn't put into words this overwhelming warmth he felt in his heart. All he knew is that he didn't want to ever not feel this again.</p>

                            <p>"Ticket please, sir?" Anhiesal looked up and there was the attendant. A vast smile on his face. He returned the jovial smile and apologized to the man. "Oh, no trouble at all, sir. It can take a little time to adjust to...well to of it."</p>

                            <p>"Yes, quite indeed. When we get there, will it still feel this good?"</p>

                            <p>"Even better, sir."</p>

                            <p>"I'm looking forward to that."</p>

                            <p>"Ticket please, sir?</p>

                            <p>"Mm? Oh yes, my ticket! Um..." Anhiesal was searching around his seat for his ticket but was having trouble locating it.</p>

                            <p>"Try your inside jacket pocket, sir"</p>

                            <p>"Oh, of course." Anhiesal looked down and he noticed he was now in one of his old work suits. He opened up the flap and pulled out a slip of paper and handed it to the attendant. "Here you are."</p>

                            <p>"Thank you, sir. Ease enjoy the rest of your trip. We will be arriving very shortly." Anhiesal turned back to his seat. A happiness that he had never felt before flooded over him. He started to close his eyes again.</p>

                            <p>"YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE!" Anhiesal nearly jumped out of his skin. He look over at the middle aged man to his side. But the man was not there. It was a young woman. Her golden hair was disheveled, her mascara was running down her cheeks. She was screaming at Anhiesal. "ANHI, GET OFF THE TRAIN!!"</p>

                            <p>"Wha-"</p>

                            <p>"Get up! You don't belong on this train! We have a stowaway!" The attendant grabbed Anhiesal's arm and nearly ripped it off getting him out of his chair.</p>

                            <p>"ANHI!!!!"</p>

							<p>The woman continued screaming as all of the passengers on the train were out of their seats grabbing Anhiesal's arms and legs. Their faces were twisted and frightening. Anhiesal's was hysterical, fighting them off.</p>
							
							<p>"NO! I don't want to go! I want to stay here! I want go to the station!" A deep fear was burning inside of Anhiesal's soul. The train car was rocking back and forth wildly as if it could derail at any moment. The lights inside the cabin were flickering on and off.</p>

							<p>"Get out!" "Stowaway!" "You don't belong with us!" The voices of the cabin were piercing his ears with their hatred and contempt.</p>

							<p>Chaos was enveloping all. Anhiesal grasped at anything he could to stay on the train. The cabin door flew open. A sharp searing wind swept through the cabin. Bright red light flooded his sight. Anhiesal's heart stopped, but he was still conscious, still clawing at the car door. </p>

							<p>"ANHI!!"</p>

							<p>"NO!!! PLEASE DON'T SEND ME AWAY!!" Anhiesal looked out the cabin door and below were no train tracks, was no ground. There were red dark storm clouds and and an endless sky. "NO!!!!"</p>

							<p>With a final push, Anhiesal was sent flying out of the train car.</p>

							<p>"Anhi..."</p>

							<p>"..."</p>

							<p>In the stillness of a moment unlike any other. There was only a gentle silence.</p>

							<p>"..."</p>

							<p>"Anhi..."</p>

							<p>A breath of air filled his nostrils. It was soft and cool. It went into his lungs and expanded into all of the cavities of his lungs. It felt like life. Around him he could hear murmurs of words that he could not make out and the sounds of machines gently beeping. It was all incoherent as if peering behind the curtain of a different reality until a woman's voice came and made it through the haze. A woman that he knew to have golden hair.</p>

							<p>"Anhi? Are you there? Anhi. Oh, my God, Anhi!!"</p>

							<p>Anhiesal Tumel opened his eyes.</p>
