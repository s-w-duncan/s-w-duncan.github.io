                            <p>It had been three days since Helena returned back to the Quetzalcoatl. During that time, Vale and Helena had kept up the pretense of their deception. They held solemn during the funeral, careful not to let on their notions of a traitor that was within their ranks. Whenever one of the crew caught Helena with a question about Tems she was able to deflect the inquiry without causing too much scrutiny. Vale on the other hand, just ignored his crew’s questions entirely. If one of them came up to him he would send them to run maintenance on the Quetzalcoatl. He kept the Hamer brothers, West and Wade, away from their navigation station by having them breakdown and reconstruct the drive assembly for the Aethon’s docking hatch. By doing this he cut off access to the systems aboard the Aethon.</p>

                            <p>Aside from keeping the charade in tact, Vale and Helena hadn’t discovered the identity of the viper within their crew. The signal that was sent through the ship’s chameleon shielding was so scrambled that neither could even locate from where in the ship the message was sent. Vale had spent the days narrowing a list of possible OA collaborators.</p>

                            <p>Se’irs was at the top of Vale’s suspicions. He’s always been uneasy about Se’irs. He was a former OA shock troop. A specialized commando that would be sent in behind enemy lines to sow chaos in the lead up to the main forces advancing from the front. As the conflicts with the Union and the Order of the Aegis lessened year after year since the official end of the Union Wars, many of the more blood thirsty members in the OA’s military deserted the bureaucracy of the Order. They left for the unaffiliated systems and many landed on the sovereign space stations like WhiteStar and it’s sister terminal BlackOrb. Se’irs, however, was on the OA Leviathan when Vale and his party broke away and liberated the Quetzalcoatl from with the ship’s main hanger. Seeing his chance to escape the mundane existence of a now antiquated soldier of the Aegis, he joined with Vale’s rebellion against the dark factions within the OA. He was brash, an opportunist, and Vale has always been weary of the man. It wouldn’t take much to sway the man away from the group’s goals, but to go back to the OA without a war to sink his teeth into could mean Vale needs to look in a different direction.</p>

                            <p>Rjn Vurlooc was next on the list. She had been a degenerate gambler and deep in debt to one of the crime lords that operated out of WhiteStar when Vale and Tems found her. She was one of the first to join their motley force when Tems had persuaded Vale to “square” the arrears, and one of the reasons the Quetzalcoatl has not returned to the station. Before she became a spieler, Din worked in the OA’s encryption and security division within the Assembly on Aegis Prime. She had been an integral part in getting past the safeguards to access the Leviathan and during the procurement of the Quetzalcoatl. Vale has always ben of the mindset that it was only a matter of time before Rjn left the crew to return to her dubious ways. </p>

                            <p>Alder Falcon, the ship’s quartermaster, was a grizzled Union commando. After he was decommissioned from the Union’s services for continuing the war effort after the last cease fire had been put into effect, Alder left to find more like-minded ships to continue his campaign. A little mentally unstable, Vale couldn’t see Alder getting into bed with his sworn enemy, but that was why he needed to be weary of the man.</p>

                            <p>Encer Thury worked the cargo bay as the rigger. He’s been wanted by the OA for a string of petty thefts and has been bouncing from ship to ship doing menial services to pass the time. When Vale found him he sensed a redeeming quality in the young man. Vale kept a short leash on Encer at the beginning, but he had exceeding all of Vales expectations of the man. On a mission where they were hacked into the OA network, Vale and Tems deleted Encer’s past record with the Order and gave him a new lease on life. After that day, Encer hasn’t once talked about going back to the OA controlled systems. Vale has chalked that up to his not so subtle infatuation with Rjn. The last time Tems talked about the ins and outs of the crew’s personal lives with Vale, which he had strongly urged her not to do, she was still amused with his youthful attempts to court her feelings. Could he have tired with her games and wanted an out back to the OA after all this time?</p>

                            <p>Jana Cotte was a dead-shot gunner. Before she joined up with the Quetzalcoatl, Jana had a sister on an OA mining colony that she adored. It was Jana’s sister that was up for a shift one day in the mines. Their specialty was working with the mining lasers. While her sister was in the mines there was an explosion and the 294 miners that were inside lost their lives. The report came back that Jana’s sister had caused the accident and Jana would receive no bereavement compensation, and was terminated from their employment. Jana disenfranchised with the OA went on a sojourn into Union space to try and find peace from losing her only family. Tems became hopelessly empathetic with the girl and persuaded Vale to let her join the crew. Vale had always suspected there wasn’t something that Jana was telling them, but Jana hadn’t once give him pause to question her place on board the Quetzalcoatl.</p>

                            <p>Rilie Reenand worked in the medical bay with Quincy. When Quincy joined the crew Rilie came with. A quiet and introspective girl, Quincy had felt pity for the orphan that had nowhere to go in the world. Like a daughter that Quincy never had he took her under wing and taught her medicine. She was very adept and was able to patch the crew up just as well as Quincy. Since they came aboard, Vale has been noticing scribbles on some of the bulkheads of what looked like star constellations. When he found her drawing one day, he asked her what they meant. She couldn’t remember and just went back to drawing. Vale’s military background was compelling him to tell her not to write on the ship, but he relented and let her continue. </p>

                            <p>Before Vale could run down more of the list he received an alert at his station aboard the bridge. It was time. Vale flipped on the intercom, “All hands to the bridge. We are entering the Tiber system.”</p>

                            <p>A few minutes past and the near two dozen members of the Quetzalcoatl filed into the long corridor of the bridge. Stations lined the sides of the hall where each of the crew members could control each aspect of the ship. As the crew came down the central gangway they gravitated towards their normal stations. They all stood looking towards the forward aperture to see the ship descend out of the speeds from the star drive. </p>

                            <p>As the crew looked on, West was looking around the deck and noticed someone missing. As West spoke, “Hey, where’s Helena-“ he was cut short of the display screens flashing warnings, the  as before them three OA heavy cruisers hung silent in space between the Quetzalcoatl and Tiber VI.</p>

                            <p>“Battle Stations!” Shouted Vale, as he started barking orders. West and Wade climbed into the navigation seats, Jana readied the ships weapons, and everyone else went to their places. The fog of war was surrounding the crew, their minds singularly focused on their specific tasks. This tunnel vision was coordinated by Vale as it always had. “Wade, turn us around! Get us outta here! West activate the star drive setup sequence. Alder engage the chameleon sheathing.”</p>

                            <p>Rjn interrupted the orders, “OA Cruisers Two and Three are powering up their weapons.”</p>

                            <p>“The other ship is moving to intercept and block our escape.” Wade yelled over his shoulder. The cross-talk between the crew began to grow louder as each moment passed and their situation looked desperate.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“How the Hells did the OA knew where we were going?”</p>

                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“Bastards! Now is the time to send them to their Gods!”</p>

                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“We’re not going to be able to make it.”</p>

                            <p>“Wade, come about 153 mark negative 87 by 41 degrees. West, input coordinates for the Alerian System. Jana, focus the cannons on the first cruiser’s sensor array. Se’irs, fire escape pods 3 through 6 towards the closest planet,” Vale's voice rang out over the chorus.</p>

                            <p>Alder bellowed out, “Incoming fire!” The crew braced themselves as the bridge shook with ferocity. Rilie was knocked out of her chair. Quincy was at her side helping her up before she had time to gain back her senses.</p>

                            <p>On Vale’s visual display unit were the calculations for the star drive’s jump to the Alerian system, but it was in the corner of the screen that held his attention. One small line of text that just appeared on the screen, “Message Sent. Nav Station 2.” Vale’s eyes slowly moved across the bridge and terminated at West Hamer. Vale’s body began to stiffen as a rage from deep within his soul swelled to dominate his body.</p>

                            <p>“WEST!”</p>

                            <p>Vale exploded out of his chair and charged at the Hamer brother. With the strength of complete mental abandonment he grabbed West by the chest and flung him across the gangway almost reaching Vale’s chair. For a moment there was complete silence on the ship as everyone froze, not knowing what to do. Standing before the crew's eyes was Vale with a pistol drawn, pointed at West who was huddled on the floor. The strained stillness was finally broken when Vale calmly said, “Quetzalcoatl. End simulation.”</p>

                            <p>The flashing lights and red warning sirens diminished and faded to their normal operating parameters. The false projection of the OA ships on the forward aperture flickered off and the asteroid cluster of Velkrim II appeared through the transparent ceiling.</p>

                            <p>Vale’s gaze did not waver from West. He was certain that no matter the answer to his next question, West’s life was sure to end today. “Tell me why I shouldn’t end you right here?”</p>

                            <p>...</p>

                            <p>Helena was curled up on her chair in the star drive’s reactor room looking at a display screen with a picture of her and Tems. There was a stillness in the air. For the last two days she had been trying to decode the message that was sent to the OA, but she could not break the encryption nor locate the origin of the transmission. The anticipation of the current moment was starting to eat at her thoughts when she heard Vale’s voice over the ship’s comm system, “All hands to the bridge…”</p>

                            <p>Helena broke out of her sullen state and began inputing the commands to commence the simulation that she and Vale had come up with the last two days. She began by deactivation all control prompts from the bridge terminals, and put them into a testing scenario where their actions would only play out on that console’s display. Once she had primed the program to start at Vale’s order, she went into the ionic radar system tree and activated the virus to attach itself to any attempt to send out messages to OA ships. The code would then send a signal back to Helena with the terminal that had been used to first send the message. </p>

                            <p>All that was left was to wait until the collaborator took the bait.</p>

                            <p>The next few minutes were the longest that Helena had yet experienced. Vale had left a one-way communication line open so that Helena could hear everything that was happening on the bridge, but they wouldn’t hear any accidental noise from the star drive assembly. It was difficult to hear anything from the bridge clearly as all the noises and voices were piling on top of each other. </p>

                            <p>Then it happened.</p>

                            <p>Across Helena’s terminal a small deviation in the frequency of the ionic radar system. She cut out the section of the frequency that was laden with the OA transmission. She ran the program she made to track back the virus’s path…</p>

                            <p>"Navigation Station 2"</p>

                            <p>There it was. Without hesitating she opened up the comm link and sent Vale the location. </p>

                            <p>A picture of the bridge appeared in her mind, and sitting at that terminal was West. “West? No it can’t, but...why?” The self doubt was almost immediate. She had spent so much time with West. He was just as passionate about engineering as she. They would talk about star theory and how it translated to navigation and from there the endless possibilities of travel through the universe. She had come to admire his intelligence and the man himself. Though they were from vastly different spectrums of society, they held a connection.</p>

                            <p>"WEST!"</p>

                            <p>Helena’s eyes past over the room and back at her display when something caught her attention. A string of unintelligible code that preceded the location output. She looked at the symbols and jumbled text. She remembered something that Rjn had told her when they first met.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“You see this, right here.” Rjn was pointing to a screen of encrypted text. </p>

                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“Yeah,” said Helena inching closer to the screen to get a better look.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRjn continued, “that string of code is a little trick that OA communicators use to mask their computer’s location.” </p>

                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“What do you mean?”</p>

                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“Well, when communicators send information through the OA networks, and they are not sure if the intelligence they are sending is accurate, they will often use this masking technique to fool the OA systems to make it seem like another tech originally sent the intel. That way, if the information turned out to be bogus they could pin it on another one of their compatriots.”</p>

                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRjn sat back in her chair with a smug look of satisfaction on her face. Helena processed this, and came back with a question. “But what if the intel turned out to be right? Wouldn’t the other person get their credit?”</p>

                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“They’re crafty little snots. If they find out that the intel came back and was something they did want to take credit for they do this-“ Rjn took the code and ran a few operations on it and it came back with the terminal id that was used. “They go back into the OA records and run the program to descramble the string and it will trigger the change in the OA servers.”</p>

                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“Wow. Do they still do this?”</p>

                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“Nah. OA brass figured out what was happening, so they changed the protocols. But you may see old intel reports with this type of text in the code. The new communicators that the OA is cranking out now do use this.”</p>

                            <p>“QUETZALCOATL. END SIMULATION.”</p>

                            <p>Helena jolted back from her memory. She looked at the errant code again, and she knew what it was.</p>

                            <p>“TELL ME WHY I SHOULDN’T END YOU RIGHT HERE?"</p>

                            <p>Vale’s voice pierced through the intercom and reverberated throughout the room. “Oh no, West.” Helena frantically fumbled over her terminal. “Vale, wait! Vale?” She remembered that Vale had muted her microphone. She could only hear what was going. Helena couldn’t contact him. To ensure her hunch was right she ran the string of code through the same program that Rjn and uploaded to the Quetzalcoatl’s computer. Since the ship was once a OA vessel the program ran the code and displayed the corrected location that the message was sent. “VALE! STOP!"</p>

                            <p>...</p>

                            <p>On the bridge, the situation was confused chaos. Nobody knew what was happening. People were shouting in every direction. “What just happened? Vale what are you doing? West? Oh, by the Gods what are you doing with a gun?"</p>

                            <p>“Vale, calm down.” Quincy had his arms outstretched trying to get Vale to lower his gun. Vale had not let his eyes escape Wests since he threw him across the gangway. </p>
                            
                            <p>“Everyone stand down,” said Vale. He was silencing, venomous with his words. “He’s a traitor. He sold out Tems. He sent a message to the OA telling them to be at the Tiber system. He was leading us into a trap. We staged this ploy to see if he would send our next location to the Order, and guess what, you did.”</p>

                            <p>Vale cocked back the hammer.</p>

                            <p>...</p>

                            <p>“Se’ris! Se’ris can you hear me? I’m shut out of the ship intercom.”</p>

                            <p>“Helena?” Se’ris was one of the only members on the ship that always had his personal communicator turned on and situated in his ear. </p>

                            <p>“It’s not West! He masked the signature, it came from...”</p>

                            <p>...</p>

                            <p>Se’ris was standing at the back of the bridge’s long corridor. West and Vale were in front of him and as he looked past them he caught sight of a gun.</p>

                            <p>“Vale it wasn’t me! I swear on Tems life!” West was pleading with Vale, but when he said her name he knew that was the worst thing he could have said. Vale became enraged by West using her name. His finger began to apply pressure to the trigger when out of the corner of his eye he saw Se’ris pulling his weapon from his side.</p>

                            <p>“VALE!” Se’ris raised his gun up and fired.</p>

                            <p>As the sound of the blast came echoing like a meteor crashing into a planet, Vale instinctively threw his weight to one side. He raised his weapon to Se’ris but before he could fire at him Vale heard a shriek from behind. He saw that Se’ris wasn’t looking at him when he fired, but at the direction the scream came from. </p>

                            <p>Wade fell to the floor screaming has he clutched at what was left of his arm. Se’ris blast had connected with the gun that was in Wade’s hand as he pointed it at Vale, ready to take the situation into his own hands and finish what he had started. When the shot hit Wade’s weapon it exploded in his hand and took half of his arm with it. </p>

                            <p>Se’ris started to walk toward Vale’s chair. Seeing him start to walk, Vale held his weapon back up at Se’ris. In response Se’ris held both of his hands up in the air but continued to walk up to the console and giving Vale a look went to turn off the intercom lock.</p>

                            <p>“Vale! Vale are you there? It wasn’t West. He masked the terminal’s ID. It came from the other nav terminal. It’s Wade. Wade sent both messages…Vale? West are you okay? Se’ris…anyone!”</p>

                            <p>There was a long silence that rumbled through the ship.</p>

                            <p>On the ground, Wade had passed out from his injury. He was bleeding and needed attention. Quincy came up and put a hand on Vale’s weapon helping him lower it down. “West is okay, Helena.” Quincy and Rilie went over to Wade and started applying a tourniquet to his arm. Other crew members went to help carry him to the infirmary. </p>

                            <p>Helena spoke through the intercom, “Oh thank the Gods!"</p>

                            <p>Vale was stricken mute. He couldn’t process what just happened. He looked at Se’ris who grunted a “You’re Welcome” to him, holstered his weapon and went back with the others who were taking Wade away. </p>

                            <p>Quincy stopped and told Rilie to get things ready and he’ll be right behind. Quincy waited until Vale turned and looked at him. The last few days finally caught up to Vale. Tears started for form in his eyes. “I’m sorry, West."</p>

                            <p>“Come on, Captain. Let’s get you back to your quarters.” Quincy escorted Vale off the bridge. As they went through the entry, Helena came running up to meet them. She looked at Vale and saw a man that was to point of pure exhaustion. She gave Quincy a nod and went onto the bridge.</p>

                            <p>“Helena!” West came over to her when he saw her walk in.</p>

                            <p>Helena smiled when she saw West still in one whole piece. She unknowingly kept that same smile for the rest of the time she spoke with him. “I’m glad you’re alright.”</p>

                            <p>“Yeah, I almost wasn’t. Thanks for saving my life.”</p>

                            <p>Helena winced slightly at West’s admirations. “Well you might want to hold your ovation until you hear the whole story.”</p>

                            <p>“So I take it we aren’t in Alerian space?” Alder voiced his approach, interrupting the two youths. </p>

                            <p>Seizing the moment to regain her composure, Helena answered, “No. We are in Velkrim.” Alder scoffed as he turned his attention towards West.</p>

                            <p>“So your brother is a turncoat, what about you?” Alder’s tone was stern and serious. </p>

                            <p>“What? No!” West was taken aback. “I have no idea what is going on here. Tems is dead. OA cruisers were just fake trying to kill us. Vale just turned into some rage crazed monster throwing me half way across the bridge, holding a gun to my head. My brother just had his arm blown off. Is Tems even dead?”</p>

                            <p>“We don’t know.” Helena said softly. </p>

                            <p>Alder thought aloud, “I suppose that’s the next course of action then.” </p>

                            <p>Helena replied, “yeah, I guess it is.”</p>

                            <p>“Well, how do we find out? Go up to an Aegis detention center and ask them if they happen to have a prisoner named Tems Queensfel in their hold?” </p>

                            <p>Both Helena and Alder looked at West for a minute without saying anything. Then Alder spoke up. “I think we start by asking your brother, if he lives."</p>
