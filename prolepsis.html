                            <p>It has been over twenty nine hours since Helena had returned from the Haret system. Vale knew this fact because Quincy kept reminding him of it. “Captain. You need to sleep. It’s been 28 hours since she got back. As the ship’s doctor I’m ordering you to take some time away from the bridge and get some rest.” Quincy was a decent man. He cared for his fellow crew members. Vale knew that he was coming from a good place when he told him to take a break, but Vale’s suspicions could not overlook any attempt, by anyone, to subvert his plan.</p>
                           
                            <p>“Thanks, but we're not in the OA or the Union, for that matter, anymore. I’ll take your counsel under advisement, Quin. I’ll get some rest soon.” Vale turned back to his display terminal.</p>
                           
                            <p>Quincy shrugged his shoulders and got up his chair situated on the other side of the bridge. “Alright, Captain. But I’m not carrying you to your bunk when you pass out in your chair.”</p>
                           
                            <p>Vale looked at a notification coming across his screen. “29.” He dismissed Quincy’s message and went back to his work.</p>
                            
                            <p>...</p>
                           
                            <p>Back in the medical bay, Quincy sat back in his chair. The seat creaked in anguish from the man’s extra girth. “He’s going to run himself ragged.” Quincy said, half to himself.</p>
                           
                            <p>“He did just lose the woman he loved, Quincy.” Rilie Reenand said as she walked into the room.</p>
                            
                            <p>“I suspect that’s true, although the Captain is too damn stubborn to say it out loud.”</p>
                            
                            <p>“Do you think we can get some new neural kinetic implants for the crews’ body armor?” Rilie was matter-of-fact about her question. Quincy began to wonder if the orphan he took in ten years ago even had a functioning emotional center in her brain. A point he never voiced to her. “I think I remember there was a market on one of the moons in the Tiber sector that sold tech mods. We are going to Tiber aren’t we?"</p>
                            
                            <p>Quincy dropped his musings on Rilie’s pyschological traumas and focused back on the present. “Uh, yeah. I think that’s what the captain said. Although, come to think about it I haven’t seen any ship’s status updates that Vale usually sends out to everyone. An old habit he still has from his days with the Order.”</p>
                            
                            <p>As if only realizing now, Rilie asked, “Oh, did you need to talk about Tems death?”</p>
                            
                            <p>“What?” Replied Quincy as he was caught by surprised from her abrupt conversational change. “I-uh-no, I don’t think so. Are you okay?”</p>
                           
                            <p>“I’m fine.”</p>
                           
                            <p>Once again Quincy was unsure how to respond to the blunt demeanor of the young girl. She was a child when he found her while working on a distant Union colony. As one of the many orphaned children that ran amongst the alleyways begging for scraps and pickpocketing credits from tourists, Rilie struck a cord when he found her in his clinic one night looking at the tools strewn about the room. Usually he would find one or two strays a month trying to pilfer his supplies. He would run them out of his shop with a few stern words, but with Rilie she looked intrigued with the equipment. So much so, that he enlisted her help with his practice. Quincy always felt that Rilie was looking for a place to belong, and he hadn’t the heart to turn her away. </p>
                           
                            <p>He knew that she must have suffered some kind of trauma, but all these years, she’s never talked about it. As Rilie became an apt and proficient medical student, she and Quincy would take their talents to a new settlement or frigate so that Rilie could explore the galaxy. That was the only thing that she had ever asked for in the ten years they have been together. He curiosity with space was a mystery to Quincy, as she never explained her obsession with it. </p>
                            
                            <p>“Okay…Well if you ever need to talk, I’m always here for you.” This was all that Quincy could manage to say. </p>
                            
                            <p>As Rilie looked out to the exam room, she nonchalantly stated, “That Hamer brother is here.”</p>
                            
                            <p>“Uh? Oh! West, what brings you in? Quincy stood from his chair and headed over to see the pilot who looked a little worse for wear. “Whoa! What happened to you?”</p>
                           
                            <p>“Hey Quince, I cut my arm on a hydraulic pike.” West gasped as a tinge of pain ran up his arm. The three moved over to the examination table and Quincy started his inspection of the laceration. Trying not to seem like he was in pain, West feigning indifference turned toward Rilie who was hovering over Quincy. She met his stare and West opened his mouth not knowing what he intended to say. “So Miss Reenand, how are you holding up?”</p>
                            
                            <p>“I’m fine.”</p>
                            
                            <p>Rilie turned her attention back to West’s injury dispassionately saying, “The number ten suture kit?”</p>
                           
                            <p>“That will do it,” was Quincy’s response. Rilie turned and went to the supply closet as started getting everything prepped.</p>
                            
                            <p>West leaned close to Quincy and whispered, “Is she okay?” Quincy only cracked a wry smile in response. Once the tools were set Quincy and Rilie went to work irrigating the wound and then proceeded to stitch the laceration close.</p>
                            
                            <p>After Quincy started getting into a rhythm with his work, he let his typical bedside manner show through. “Rilie was wondering about our next destination. We thought that the Captain said we were heading to the Tiber system?” As Quincy finished up his question he looked up from his suturing at West. He looked back at the ship’s doctor eyes that were peeking up through the top rim of his glasses. </p>
                            
                            <p>“Yeah, I think so. I don’t really remember too much from yesterday.”</p>
                            
                            <p>Quincy was surprised. “You haven’t been up at the con since yesterday?” </p>
                            
                            <p>West looked back at Quincy and Rilie who also stopped her work and was staring at West. “No, I haven’t. The captain has Wade and I working on the airlock assembly for the Aethon.”</p>
                            
                            <p>“The airlock?” Quincy inquired going back to West’s arm.</p>
                            
                            <p>“Yeah, when Helena docked, one of the hydraulic levers malfunctioned. So, we are having to replace the entire drive assembly for it.”</p>
                            
                            <p>“Interesting. So, we can’t use the Aethon now if we needed to?”</p>
                            
                            <p>“Nope. The airlock is sealed up until we finish.”</p>
                            
                            <p>“Interesting.” Quincy said again almost as a reflex. </p>
                            
                            <p>“If you say so, doc. I’m just glad it gives me something to do. Leaving us to our own thoughts after what happened to Tems…it’s just good to be doing some work.”</p>
                            
                            <p>Putting down his tools after finishing his last stitch, Quincy leaned back in his chair. “I can understand that. It’s horrible what happened to her. Well, how does it feel?”</p>
                            
                            <p>West flexed the muscle in his forearm. Another tinge of pain ran up through his arm. Flinching a little, West replied, “It still hurts a little, but I mean you did great, it looks brand new. Ouch!” Not noticing Rilie’s movements, she had come up to him and administered a shot of medication after hearing West say his arm was still hurting.’</p>
                            
                            <p>“There you go. That should help with the pain.” The response from Rilie was right on cue with her calm demeanor. </p>
                            
                            <p>“Oh, thanks, Miss Reenand.” West said as he rubbed his arm where the needle punctured his skin.</p>
                            
                            <p>Quincy got up from his chair and started helping Rilie clean up. “You’re good as new, Mr. Hamer. Let me know if there is any residual pain in a few days.” </p>
                            
                            <p>“Thanks Quincy. See you both at the Mess later.”</p>
                            
                            <p>...</p>
                            
                            <p>West instinctively rubbed his arm as he left the med bay and started walking down the hallway, back to the Aethon. Climbing down two decks he found Wade at the airlock hard at work. Pieces of the hydraulic assembly were scattered all over the floor.</p>
                            
                            <p>“Doc, get you squared away?” asked Wade as he heard the footsteps come up behind him. </p>
                            
                            <p>West came up alongside his brother showing him his arm. “Good as new.”</p>
                            
                            <p>“That man does good work.” </p>
                            
                            <p>“Where are we with this thing?” Wes said as he was taking stock of the progress Wade made while his was gone.</p>
                            
                            <p>Wade stopped tightening down a bolt and looked back at the parts strewn about giving out an audible sigh. “I don’t know, I think we still got at least two days with this thing, unless Helena can help us out with this. Do you want to go see if she can?”</p>
                            
                            <p>“I don’t know, didn’t Vale say we should give her some time?”</p>
                            
                            <p>“Yeah, I guess.”</p>
                            
                            <p>“Well, I should probably go she if she’s doing alright.”</p>
                            
                            <p>Wade smiled at his brother, knowing the way West pines over her when he thinks no one’s watching. “Sure thing, West. You go check on her and I’ll just stay here, you know, working.”</p>
                            
                            <p>“Thanks, man!” West joyfully got up and headed up to the next deck.</p>
                            
                            <p>“I hate you!” Wade shouted back as his brother left him alone with the airlock pieces in his hands. </p>
                            
                            <p>...</p>
                            
                            <p>West started up the gangway across the row of crew quarters making his way through the corridors and down the access tunnels to the first of the large blast doors that marked the entrance to the engineering deck situated on the under belly of the Quetzalcoatl. There was a main lift that ran through the center of the ship, but none of the crew used it. He tapped the access panel by the door and activated the communicator inside the room. A sound echoed along the engineering deck as Helena looked up from her terminal.</p>
                            
                            <p>Along the intercom, West’s voice came through, “Hey, Helena, um, how are you doing?” West rolled his eyes at the naive and inane question. ‘I mean, do you need anything?”</p>
                            
                            <p>Inside, Helena activated the door’s outer camera and saw West figeting and shifting back and forth on his heels. Over the last year since West and Wade had come aboard, she had noticed the extra glances and the strain attempts to engage in small talk. But for the most part she felt that he was harmless and a competent pilot. Through the majority of her life, Helena was focused on her work and did not let personal romantic entanglements distract her from invention. Current tensions, however, have forced her to reexamine all interactions with the crew, and the jovial personality that she normally exuded was filled with apprehension and skepticism. This change of mannerism was easily covered up with the guise of emotional distress and loss. </p>
                            
                            <p>“Hi, West.” Helena said calmly, not wanting to betray her feelings. “I’m okay, thanks for checking in, but I’m in the middle of realigning the chameleon systems.”</p>
                            
                            <p>“Oh, yeah…right. I was, um, just wanting to see if you had some time to help Wade and I with the Aethon’s docking assembly, but that, uh, I guess that was dumb of me to ask.” </p>
                            
                            <p>“Thanks okay, West.”</p>
                            
                            <p>“So do you need any help with the drive core?”</p>
                            
                            <p>Helena paused, and then continued “I thought you were working on the Aethon’s airlocks?”</p>
                            
                            <p>“Yes. Right. I am. Yes. Ok, well I’ll leave you to it. I need to get back. Bye, Helena.” </p>
                            
                            <p>“Bye, West.”</p>
                            
                            <p>As she watched West leave the view of the camera, Helena slumped back in her chair. “Tems…please still be alive."</p>
