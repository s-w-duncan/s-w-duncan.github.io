							<p>Helena stood in front of Vale, not being able to speak. Looking at him, all she could do was shake her head as tears streamed down her face.</p>

                            <p>“Helena, where’s Tems?” Vale’s tone was soft, controlled. Vale Sindrake was waiting by the airlock when the Aethon finished docking, there was a foreboding sense in Helena’s voice when she uploaded the docking passcode. When Tems wasn’t at the airlock when the doors opened, Vale’s heart sank.</p>
                            
                            <p>Helena opened her mouth and stagnated sobs poured out in between her words, “I’m sorry Vale, she told me to go. I wanted to stay-“ Vale moved up to Helena and put his arms around her. “I don’t know how they knew. We were careful. The encryption worked. We started downloaded the schematics. Explosions. The OA. They were right on top of us. Didn’t have enough time to get her back to the ship.” After getting all of the words out, she stiffened and looked up at Vale. "Vale, it was Casus.”</p>

                            <p>“You mean it was an OA cruiser?”</p>

                            <p>Helena shook her head, “No, I mean it was the Leviathan. He was there.”</p>

                            <p>This took Sindrake aback. They were in Haven. They were nowhere near any central OA military command center. That meant that Oberdine Casus, the admiral of the entire Assembly contingent of the military was operating in a completely different Vitale Arme. There was only one reason why he would take the flagship of the Order of the Aegis this far into Union controlled space. He was finally, personally, hunting Vale and the Quetzalcoatl down, to exact his revenge on them.</p>

                            <p>Yet that was not the most insidious realization Vale had. He looked back at Helena. “You’re completely sure it was the Leviathan?” She could only nod her head. “Helena, you can’t say any of this to the others.”</p>

                            <p>“What?”</p>

                            <p>“Helena, how could Casus know where you were going to be? How was it that it was him to be the one to be there.” Helena began thinking critically, trying to push her emotions down. “If you would have set off any of the sensor relays, it wouldn’t have been the Leviathan that intercepted you. Someone had to have tipped them off to our plans.”</p>

                            <p>“Vale, no…”</p>

                            <p>“We have a traitor on our ship, Helena. Loyal to the OA or the Assembly. Maybe even to the Missive.” That last thought sent shivers down Vale’s spine. But one he couldn’t dwell on. He took great care with his next question. “Helena, d-did you see Tems killed in the explosions?”</p>

                            <p>Helena thought a long time. She slowly started talking, “I, I don’t think I did. She was still strapped on the satellite when I engaged the star drive. I think I saw some interceptors breaking off the Leviathan’s hull right before I lost sight of her.”</p>

                            <p>It was all Vale could help to hope for, there’s a chance she was captured. Locked aboard the most feared ship in all of Hom’age. It was a thought that Vale didn’t want to dwell on. The ramifications of such a circumstance for Tems could be far worse than a quick death. Sindrake focused back on the situation that he could do something about.</p>

                            <p>“Helena, Tems could still be alive. If I was Oberdine, I would have wanted to capture her, not kill her. I need your help to find the OA loyalist on the Quetzalcoatl. Go back-“</p>

                            <p>Helena started to protest, “Vale, don’t you think it could have been me, I mean I am-“</p>

                            <p>“Helena, I know it wasn’t you. There’s not a doubt in my mind you could have done that to her, to us.”</p>

                            <p>“Captain…”</p>

                            <p>“Go back to your quarters get your equilibrium back. Then I need you back in the star drive as soon as you can. We have work to do.” Vale gave Helena a reassuring look. “Go.” Helena looked up at Vale and smiled back at him and then she left down the corridor towards the crew quarters.</p>

                            <p>Vale hunched over and braced himself up against the airlock, taking a moment to compose himself. “It should have been me out there Tems. I’m sorry.” He slammed his fist against the hatch. The sound echoed down the hallway. As he stood up and wiped his eyes clear.  He turned to look if anyone was around. For now, everyone else on the Quetzalcoatl was suspect. One of his crew has been lying to him. Every day. Every interaction. He was going to find them, and see them atone for what they had done to Tems. He stepped toward the command panel and switched on the ship’s internal com.</p>

                            <p>“This is Vale. I need everyone on the bridge. Now.”</p>

                            <p>...</p>

                            <p>When the door to the bridge opened, all of the crew turned their attention to Vale Sindrake. He walked in and surveyed the long hall of the Quetzalcoatl bridge. More than twenty outlaws of the OA all stood at his attention. All of them had sworn their allegiance to his cause; to bring to light the corruption that festered within the Order, the genocides of entire colonies. All atrocities justified by military leadership in the furthering of the Assembly throughout the galaxy. Now, one of those that he trusted, could be a wolf.</p>

                            <p>Vale looked at each of his crew, one after one. Leaving a lasting glare on each one’s soul. After the prolonged silence he addressed his crew.</p>

                            <p>“Tems is dead.”</p>

                            <p>The exasperated voices of the group erupted spontaneously upon him finishing his sentence. He took great care to watch each one as they all processed the news.</p>

                            <p>One voice made its way through the confusion. “Is Helena okay?” It was Quincy. The ship’s doctor. He was a large and affable man. Big bushy beard and rather a peculiar turn on the normal OA medical officer. He was serving on the medical frigate OA Phoenix when it was called by a distress signal from a colony on the outer reaches of the Order’s space. The colony was overrun by a deadly and unknown pathogen. When compassion and perseverance were needed, the Order’s military commander ordered a planetary quarantine of the colony and destroyed all of the communications arrays by bombarding the planet from orbit. The incident and colony was redacted from all Assembly records. When Quincy voice his opposition to the orders and tried to help the citizens of the colony before the bombing, he was court marshaled and stripped of all medical credentials. From then on Quincy negotiated passage and accommodations in Union controlled space in return for his services. Bouncing from ship to ship Quincy had lost his direction and purpose in life since his life in the OA, until he ran into Vale and his crew. There he felt as if he could make amends for failing those colonists by bringing the OA to account for their actions and those responsible for condemning those poor souls to die a gruesome death, and maybe Quincy may be able to find a cure for the Ragnos virus.</p>
                            
                            <p>“She’s fine physically, Quincy. She’s under deck in her quarters. But this wound is going to fester inside of each one of us.” Vale kept surveying the crew. “If anyone needs to talk, my door is open to you. Tems Queensfel will be deeply missed. She dedicated herself to our cause with every piece of herself. She gave freely of her heart to each of us.” Vale cut short. He didn’t realize that his spurious speech would have affected like it did. Even though he believed her to still be alive, there is a chance he may have to give the same eulogy one day. “But,” he continued after composing himself, “we don’t have time to morn. Before she escaped from the OA inceptors, Helena had decoded some of the Order’s communications. They have redoubled their efforts to track us down. We need to make sure they don’t get the opportunity. We are going to the Tiber system to wait out they’re search and once we can establish they have grown tired of chasing their prey we will get back to our mission.”</p>

                            <p>Throughout the crew there was a certain resignation that came with the news that they were going to run and hide instead of getting revenge for Tems' death.</p>

                            <p>“That’s all everyone. West, Wade you can take the rest of the shift off. I’ll take the helm. Take some time everyone, raise a glass for Tems and remember her life with joy. She would have wanted it that way.” Vale turned and sat down at his command station.</p>

                            <p>With Vale’s last words, the room fell silent and the crew started filing out of the bridge leaving Sindrake alone on the bridge. After a moment of looking out the main aperture into the black void of space, Vale turned his attention back to the holographic command screen position to the right of his chair. With a few inputs of the controls he brought up a picture of the Tiber system. He narrowed his gaze on the planets rotating around its star. He swiped out of the system and zoomed in on a neighboring sector, the Velkrim system and its sparse rocky moons and gas giants that circled the red dwarf. He selected one of the moons of the fifth planet and went to work inputting the calculations to activate the star drive.</p>

                            <p>When the computations had been entered and accepted by the navigation system Vale sat back in his chair. His thoughts of the last hour had weighed heavy on his mind. In just under the time it took to sit down for a long meal with his comrades his entire world changed. Tems was gone, not gone-‘captured’, being tortured at the hands of Admiral Oberdine Casus, and there was an apostate within the very walls of his ship. This tergiversator has betrayed all of them, turned their back on everything they have been fighting to accomplish.</p>

                            <p>Vale sat a long while, not moving, staring out as the stars seemed to blur and streak across the space around him.</p>

                            <p>A small notification came across his control screen. Vale’s attention focused back on his ship. He opened the com line, on the other side it was Helena’s voice that came through.</p>

                            <p>“You were right, Captain. I detected interference in the ship’s shielding array. A message was sent through the ionic radar system.”</p>

                            <p>“Are you able to track it back to the console that was used to make the communication?”</p>

                            <p>“I’m working on it. They ran it through multiple sub relays. It’s going to take me a while to unravel it.”</p>

                            <p>“Let me know when you have it. Don’t let anyone in there alone with you, Helena.”</p>

                            <p>“I won’t…Vale?”</p>

                            <p>“Yes?”</p>

                            <p>“I’m sorry. I should have seen this sooner. Maybe if I did…”</p>

                            <p>“Helena, this isn’t your fault. We will get her back.”</p>

                            <p>“Aye Captain.”</p>
