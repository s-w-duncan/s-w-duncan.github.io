							<p>The twin suns of Rei and Sel were perched at their zeniths high in the sky over the vast arid desert of the north eastern of region of the Selician territories. The rays of the twin stars beat down upon the earth with relentless fury. The heat rising up from the sand danced and reflected off the blue sky in a mesmerizing illusion. Excepting the mountain ranges that dotted the far reaches of the horizon, the land was barren, near lifeless. The insects and pockets of life that did lie underneath the surface were waiting for the night, when the reprieve from the suns allowed them to go about their duties of scavenging the countryside to survive another day.</p>

							<p>The beasts and natives to the land knew of the dangers of being out in the open ranges of sand and dirt. Intrich Balfor was not a native of the land nor did he care about the warnings of the insects and creatures that scurried away in the daylight. Standing in midst of land that stretched on for miles he was a short and squatty Selician man, older in age but still spry in bones. His skin was wrinkled and dried out from countless years spent out in the wastes of the desert. Leathered and aged beyond his age he did not mind the heat. He had suffered his time in the deserts of the land and relished in the quiet of the days out in the sprawling deserts that covered the continent of Rei and Sel, named after their respected dominant stars. </p>

							<p>Intrich licked his lips with his dried and sandpaper like tongue. The scratchy sensation was used more to by time to think than to try and moisten his lips. Looking out beyond the mounds of sand before him he tried to cast his knowledge of the terrain to guide his triffon, a lumbering pack animal of considerable size used by traders to traverse distance and carry their wares, to a safe harbor for the night. The mountains and eastern coast of the land were still a two day’s travel away. Intrich did not come to be this old in life by succumbing to exhaustion and stupidity. Within a few more solar cycles he would need to rest and set up camp for the night, when the real dangers would reveal themselves and stalk their prey with conviction and deadly determination. </p>

							<p>His eyelids narrowed on the distant horizon, his heavy and thick skin nearly overlapping his eyes as he spied the landscape. A lone sparrow beat its winds as it glided across the sky. Aside from that, nothing. The sky was clear, not a cloud in the sight. The land was still. Intrich felt a chill run down his spine. Like the warning of an unknown danger from deep within his soul. Then as if an apparition coming to fulfill the prophesy of his body’s reaction, there was a great rumbling from above the mountains to his back. As he turned he saw a bright brilliant flash of light above the mountains. Then came the shockwave of a blast that was greater than any explosion known to exist to all Selicians. Across miles of sand and rock, the shockwave spread over the land with a speed that was almost as fast as sound itself, and it was heading straight for Intrich.</p>

                            <p>The sand felt like needles as thousands of particles pelted his skin. Intrich instinctively fell to the ground and huddled around his triffon trying to escape the pain and rampage of nature itself. “Sel’s fury!” Intrich thought as he clung to his animal. The wind blasted the ground and Intrich felt as the sand beneath his body sift out underneath him and felt the pressure of the gust lift up his triffon and flung it and Intrich across the land. When he hit the ground everything went black. But for an instant before that moment when his eyes were open he thought he saw another flash of brilliant dazzling light and a streak racing across the sky to the ground below. </p>
                            
                            <p>When Intrich regained consciousness, he was disoriented and had a wrenching pain in his back. As his eyes opened he saw his triffon, laying down beside him licking his hoofs. The triffon looked up at his shepard and gave him a long glare then shook off some of the sand from its large mane and went back to his grooming. In the following minutes, Intrich took stock of his body, inventories, and finally his location. He was amazed to see that the whole landscape had changed. The sand dunes which he had traversed for days had all been wiped clear. All that was left was barren rock, cracked and rubbed smooth. When Intrich looked behind him, far away from the torrent’s epicenter, he saw with widen eyes  vast mountain ranges of sand that blotted out the horizon line. These new sand dunes reached thousands of feet into the sky. Intrich was now in the middle of largest crater in Selician history. </p>

                            <p>Curiosity took Intrich further into the crater. Against his better judgment. There was a drive that he never felt before compelling him to continue to the crater’s center, as if it were calling out to him. The closer he got, the stronger the urge, the more he was convinced that he could hear the voice pressing him to keep going. With each step his pace quickened until he was running as fast as his short legs could manage. His triffon was pulling against its reigns, as if warning his master of the dangers beyond. Intrich’s rage with his stubborn animal grew as he tossed his companion aside in his overwhelming obsession to find what was waiting for him at the center’s apex.  </p>

                            <p>The insects that lived deep within rocky fissures stirred from the upheaval of the land were crawling out of their homes for the first time. Some found themselves being trampled under the heel of a heavy footed Selician. The desire within his soul was overtaking all of Intrich’s thoughts. He did not notice that his footsteps failed to sound like his boots hitting the hard ground of rock. It was now soft and cushioned under tens of thousands of insects all scurrying away from the deep inset crater that laid in the center of that bright brilliant flash of light that filled the sky.  </p>

                            <p>Further. Intrich needed to go further. It called for him. The pervasiveness of this urge was the only thing that mattered. It would take him to the other side of life if that’s what it asked of him. Each step filled Intrich with more ecstasy more happiness than he ever felt before. All of the world fell away from him as he clawed his way over a mound of rock and dirt to gaze over the expansive crater below. Nearly a hundred meters deep, the fissure in the earth carved out a perfect sphere. Intrich flung himself into the crater. Sliding down the walls on his stomach, his arms swimming over the stones Intrich was crazed. His triffon reached the edge of the crater and just gazed down at his master with all of the impassioned torpor an animal could garner.  </p>

                            <p>Intrich came to stop near the bottom of the crater. Gravity having completed its part, Intrich got up and finished the race to the center. Gasping for breath, his head piercing with the pain of a blade embedded within his skull, he saw it.  </p>

                            <p>It was magnificent. Glorious. </p>

                            <p>To the triffon, it would look like a rock. A pretty looking rock. Its hues subtly changed depending on how the light struck it. But a rock, none the less. To Intrich though, it was all that mattered in the universe. He stood in the crater until the rays of Sel started to fade over the horizon starring down at the meteorite now in his hands. It was cool to the touch, yet it filled Intrich with a warmth that permeated through his body. Intrich turned to make his way back out of the crater’s depth. He clutched the rock close to his chest. He knew that his life had just started. </p>

                            <p>As Intrich left the crater and traveled back to his life, never to return to this place again, there, left in the crater, the skeletal remains of an arm. Tiny fractures radiating out from the middle of the forearm from where a terrifying artifact was imbedded into it long ago.  </p>
