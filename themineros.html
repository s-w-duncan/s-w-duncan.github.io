							<p>In the midst of the 58th Campaign the Seph Contingent was desperate. The Aelian forces were splintering the Seph’s battlements all along the Titan Fields. It wouldn’t be long before they would have to pull back from the entire region. Countless acres of farmland, crops needed to sustain their cities and villages would have to be abandoned. Not in recent memory have the Sephs been so overwhelmed  during the Great Campaigns. If they lose hold of their settlements in the Fields, starvation would run rampant within the capital city and outlying villages. When the icy winds begin their season of assault on the northern mountain ranges where the Sephs have borrowed their cities into in an impressive and ancient feat of engineering and architecture, the losses will be felt by all Sephs.</p>

                            <p>The Council, the ruling class of the Seph civilization, in an unprecedented move voted to send a pilgrimage to the Tower of Heaven and beseech the Supreme Goddess, Aelia to intervene on their behalf. Ever since the start of the age of the Great Campaigns, Seph and Aelian have not dared attempt to commune with their Goddess. Stories and songs are still recited from the Expulsion during the previous age when Aelia came down from her great floating castle and excised the gifts she had bestowed upon the children of the land. The entrances to her tower were now guarded by immortal and fearsome beasts that have since been named the Guardians to block all from entering the Stairway, the only want to reach the Tower. Few have ever entered any of the Gateways that surround the Tower of Heaven, for death was certain at the hands of the Guardians. Until now.</p>
                            
                            <p>...</p>

                            <p>The convoy of soldiers, servants, priests, acolytes, and the curious reached the crest of the final hill that looked out over the Guardians Gateway and the Tower of Heaven beyond. For many long moments all that congregated there stood silent in awe of the magnificent and awe inspiring beauty of Aelia’s creation. The Tower of Heaven sat atop the world, reaching far higher than the clouds of the world. When the clouds were wisps in the sky you could catch a glimpse of the glistening marble interwoven into the natural stone and rock of the floating mountain top that was called the Tower. Pilars of ivory hundreds of meters high that marked the entrance into the Goddess’s temple reflected the sun’s rays in brilliant hues of illuminating colors that could not be found any place else in the world. Below the Tower were a myriad of floating land masses. Shaped like inverted pyramids, it was said that the Goddess Aelia ripped the land from its moorings to bridge the divide that separated the distance between her and her children. Each “step” suspended in air mirrored its appearance to Aelia’s Tower. Endless waterfalls fell from each step into a Maelstrom below. </p>

                            <p>At the middle of the world, the Tower of Heaven sat atop the most fearsome of forces that could be fathomed. An enormous and unending whirlpool lay at the center of the world. It size rivaled the largest continents of the earth, the waves that circled restlessly were as large as mountains, crashing upon one another as the torrent of water consumed anything that it touched, all the while swirling down to the center of the planet itself. There was no shoreline. The three continents of the world were shielded from the Maelstrom by cliffs that rose up higher than the tremendous waves. Sheer cutoffs of razor like rock adorned the interior facing coastlines protecting the inhabitants of the earth and land. </p>

                            <p>The sight of it all brought tears to those who viewed it for the first time. Upon the hills of the Seph homeland those that did not immediately fall down to their knees in prayer were struck with the gravity of their mission and the enormity of task that was given to them, and the futility that was sure to meet them once they crossed the Gateway. </p>

                            <p>Standing off to the far end of the ligation was a young Seph man. The ridges on his nose bridge were pointed and symmetrical, a rarity among his kind. His ears pointed and sharpened as was the custom of all Seph that went into the military service. The scaly exterior of his skin was well cared for and reflected the light as well as the healthiest Seph. His stature screamed of courage and impressiveness, youth his only noticeable flaw compared to those of experience. Yet beside his demeanor, the young man was indeed timid and unsure of himself. Feeling as if he is thrown from one situation to another, he never felt he had any control over his own life. That insecurity he buried deep within his defenses, but regardless of what he felt of his life within the Seph military caste his life was obligated to the glory of the Contingent. As is the same with all Seph soldiers. </p>

                            <p>“As’heme! Looks like you have a new friend.”</p>

                            <p>The young man snapped from his wonderment back to the present. He looked around to see the face of the familiar voice. He turned around and saw a stout Seph, about a foot shorter and wider. Ne’himer was his given name, but he preferred Hammer. A point made more clear when someone saw him in battle. He was a reluctant friend to As’heme since the young man took to the traditional ways of the Seph, and Hammer did not. Using a name other than that the one given to you at birth was considered disrespectful and was not looked well upon when trying to rise through the hierarchy of Seph society. But Hammer cared little for ceremony and tradition, but rather enjoyed the moment with a hearty laugh that reverberated within his stomach and a mug of ale. A view that As’heme found refreshing. So he often found himself in Hammer’s company, and beside him on the field of battle. When Ne’himer was locked in the heat of the fight, there was few that could best him. Many had tried, and his body was covered in its fair share of scars and stories, but he has not lost a step from the year of his maturity. </p>

                            <p>“What?” As’heme was still trying to piece together Hammer’s meaning. </p>

                            <p>With a laugh and a firm slap on his back, Hammer bellowed out, “Look below you, lad.”  And there around As’heme’s feet was a little rodent looking back at him. The creature was no larger than a rabbit, it’s body was covered in fur of a grayish hue with tips that almost looked translucent. It’s ears were slight and long that danced as the wind blew through the rocky outcropping of the coast line. It bobbed its head up and down as it hopped along the wild tall grass. The feet and hands of the little rabbit were hidden by its fur as it grew around the paws in a sphere of fluff. Benign and curious, the little rodent looked at As’heme with what he could only explain as amusement.</p>

                            <p>“What a peculiar little creature. Have you ever seen anything like it, Ne’himer?” As’heme never did use his friend’s nickname. Attempting to show him respect in the process.</p>

                            <p>“It looks like a normal shi’bble to me,” the name that the Seph gave to rabbits, “and it looks like he found himself a gullible fool to give him a fattening dinner tonight.” Hammer laughed deeply and slapped As’heme against the shoulder again. </p>

                            <p>“It’s magnificent Ne’himer. Aelia is truly a wonder.” As’heme said as he turned his attention back to the Tower, shooing the shi’bble away in the process.</p>

                            <p>“A bit of a conceited deity if you ask me.” A scoff from Hammer’s mouth underlined his oblivious skepticism of their mission and his views of the Goddess. </p>

                            <p>“You do not believe she will heed our prayers?”</p>

                            <p>Hammer peered at the young Seph from the corner of his eye. A small smirk etched out of the thin lips of the portly man. “Trust me, lad. That broad up there in her castle in the sky has no care about what happens down here to us mere mortals.” Why do you think she has her Guardians down here ready to obliterate any foolhearty soul dumb enough to pass those gates?” As’heme was always shocked by the brazenness of Hammer’s bravado. </p>

                            <p>“You know that’s sacrilegious?”</p>

                            <p>“May the Goddess smite my rotund arse upon the rocks this very moment if I’ve displeased her!” Ne’himer was loud and boisterous with his indignation. As’heme for a moment thought about stepping away from Hammer, just in case. Knowing that he would mock himself incessantly for the rest of the night he stood his ground. A few of the priests and acolytes turned and glanced at Ne’himer under the hoods of their cloaks, but none said a word to the overbearing Seph. They prayed that Aelia would judge his heresy swiftly and severely one day. Their thoughts were drowned out when the Overseer, leader of the pilgrimage, cracked his great iron staff against the rock face of the cliff. </p>

                            <p>“We make camp here. In honor of her glory. Tomorrow we cross the Gateway and ascend the Tower of the Heaven. The hopes of all Sephs rest upon our great crusade. Take homage that our prayers will be heard by her magnificent grace and our people will know victory. We are the chosen heirs of Aelia and tomorrow we will unite the land under the Seph Contingent!”</p>

                            <p>Cries of glory rang out from the crowds, prayers of victory were uttered from the priests, and As’heme felt a shiver run through his spine.</p>

                            <p>The pilgrimage set up tents and their bedrolls all along the cliff edge. The fury of the Maelstrom far below those rocks swirled in the dreams of those that were unfortunate enough to fall asleep. As’heme laid away and stared at the twin moons, Ail and Nel, in the darkness of the night sky. His thoughts drifted off to prophesies he learned when he was a child. He thought back about the omens the priests spoke of on the journey. Those of Ail and Nel, when they dance together in the summer solstice calamity would soon follow. He didn’t know if they were real or not. There had always been moments of joy and despair at times in his life. None of it seemingly on the whim of superstitions and spiritual beliefs. As the twin moons move closer together, threatening to collide and rain down rock and fire upon the world, As’heme wondered if he shouldn’t say a prayer to Aelia, just in case.</p>

                            <p>There was a slight rustle in the grass a few feet away from As’heme. He instinctively clutched the hilt of his sword as he waited for the noise to pass or to take action. He narrowed his eyes trying to decipher the sound when two ears popped up out of the foliage. Then came the nose and eyes of the shi’bble he had seen earlier. It stayed looking straight up in the air as if staring at the same two satellites that As’heme had been. He loosened his grip on his sword and eased back against his elbow. “What are you looking at little shi’bble?” As’heme made up his bed away from the main ligation so his voice could not be heard. The small animal turned its head to look at As’heme. It’s head cocked to one side and looked at him with that look of amusement that he had seen earlier. “You are a curious little thing aren’t you?” Another twitch of its ears and this time it looked directly into As’heme’s eyes. “You need to be careful though on who you sneak up to. Some of those other Sephs might think you look a little too delicious to let scampering about. You’re lucky I don’t care for shi’bble meat.” It’s ears twitched again sticking straight out, then as quickly as it appeared it ran back into the grass disappearing into the thicket. “Well, then. Goodbye to you, too.” As’heme laid back down on the rolled fabric of his bedding and closed his eyes.</p>

                            <p>Sleep came to As’heme begrudgingly that night. He had visions of him standing alone at the doors of the Tower of Heaven. As the doors opened a brilliant flash of light blinded him as he violently jerked himself awake. </p>

                            <p>The sun was cresting over the mountains and he heard the horn of the Overseer blaring out across the valleys of the coastal cliffs signally the ligations call to depart.</p>

                            <p>The company wearily packed up their camps from the restless night and set out for the Gateway’s entrance. As’heme fell beside Ne’himer at the end of the ligation. The two exchanged quips and barbs throughout the morning’s march until they came up to the last ridge of the coastal cliffs. There was a dip in the rocks and a pathway stretched out underneath the mountain. A tunnel was dug out of the earth as it led out across the edge of the land. Standing at the rearmost precession of the pilgrimage high on the last ridge of the coast As’heme could see out across the Guardians Gateway for the first time. Each Gateway scattered across all of the continent’s coasts around the world were massive land masses, miles across and deep, floating out away from the land, holding position over the Maelstrom’s mighty waves. Connecting the Guardians perch to the mainland was a single bridge made of disconnected slabs of stone hovering a few feet apart from one another and hundreds of feet above the crashing waters below.</p>

                            <p>“Steady on your feet!” As’heme could see the beginning of the ligation make its first steps across the bridge. Shouts of warning, fear, and encouragement rang out from the bridge. “Watch out for the winds!” “Hold on to your equipment!” “Aelia’s grace save us sinners!” A sudden sweeping gust of wind came up from the Maelstrom and struck the bridge. Priests clutching their cloaks tightly around themselves, soldiers holding onto their weapons and packs were all pushed off the bridge like leaves blown off a tree. Screaming they fell into the raging tidal forces below.</p>

                            <p>Voices from those that considered themselves leaders of the ligation came roaring up over the anguish cries. “Pull yourselves up! Aelia is testing us all. Push on towards the Tower. Your families are depending on you!”</p>

                            <p>“Still believe in the compassionate grace of Aelia?” Ne’himer’s voice cut through the dull ringing in As’heme’s ears. The two Sephs stood overlooking the grim and nauseating visage that was playing out before them. Neither man felt any heavy emotional tie to what they were witnessing. A dull apathy seemed to wash over As’heme in that moment, as if he was disconnected with his own life in a way he had never felt before. Still the pilgrimage continued. As more Sephs were swept off the bridge, As’heme came closer to the bridge’s beginning. In the distance he could see the first few Seph soldiers reaching the other side of the bridge and taking their first steps onto the Gateway.</p>

                            <p>For the first time in generations, Sephs stood upon the Gateway of the Guardian. Shouts of joy rang out from the crowd gathered on the steps of the Gods. They could feel divinity on that earth, suspended high above the torrent of destruction below. But as if the Gods themselves heard their jubilation and turned their backs to them, the winds surged and blistered those remaining on the bridge. Those that did not fall into the Maelstrom collapsed to the stone steps clinging to the slabs of floating rock for their lives. Praying to Aelia for salvation, praying that they live another minute.</p>

                            <p>As’heme clutched against the boulders that led to the bridge. His heart racing at the intensity of the God’s wrath. He felt a strong hand on his shoulder, “Listen to me, lad.” Ni’himer was behind him ushering him onward. “We all die. But at least we’ll get to spit in the eye of the Gods when we do.” As’heme laughed as he grabbed ahold of his new friend and they stepped across the first step.</p>

                            <p>Each slab step was the length of the house As’heme grew up in at the base of the Lo’thor mountain range. The width of each step could only hold around five Sephs standing side by side. To As’heme’s surprise the steps felt as if he were still on solid ground. Against the winds, the steps did not budge. He felt a certain amount of security as he stepped. This surprised him more than he thought it would. Almost Aelia was protecting them. Of course Ni’himer would have laughed right in his face if he would have told him that. So As’heme braced himself against the surge of wind and continued to make another step towards the Gateway.</p>

                            <p>Half way across the bridge now, As’heme was feeling like the torment would never end. That he would never get across this expanse. The Maelstrom was inviting him into its finality. He turned and looked at Ni’himer who was looking even worse than he. The rallying cry’s the contingent already across the bridge were drowned out by the roaring of the winds. Just as he started to feel the crushing torrent would send him into the next life, he caught the sight of something out of the corner of his eyes. The small shi’bble was there at the end of his feet. It looked at him with the same curious gaze that it did the two times before. Then as if it were a calm and beautiful summer day, it hopped merrily along the bridge weaving in and out of the huddled Sephs yelling out to the heavens. He watched the little rodent as long as he could until it was covered by the remaining Sephs on the bridge. As’heme got up to his feet and began to push on. </p>

                            <p>The Gateway at the end of the bridge was even more magnificent as As’heme thought from across the bridge. With Ni’himer and the last few Seph priests he had reached the threshold of the Guardian’s floating mountain. They had made it. Their first trial was over. Now they would face one of Aelia’s Guardians.</p>

                            <p>Of the six known Gateways spread out on the inner perimeter of the two western continents of the world, all of the Guardians of each had made their presence known to the inhabitants of their surrounding lands. The Great Titan had claimed the lands in between the Seph and Aelian territories. It was in his Fields that the Great Campaigns raged on for generations. The dragon Gal’drake hunted in the mountains and plains of the Southern Continent. All save for the Gateway closest to the Seph capital. There was always speculation of some invisible specter that came out at night and feasted on any that dared venture into its lands. Any lost traveler would be said to have been the latest poor soul to have been devoured by the specter. Occasionally, some group of Seph settlers would venture close to the Gateway and try to establish a village community. Each time they did, one day when a messenger from the capital arrived, the buildings would be deserted or in the case of one instance, the inhabitants were brutally murdered, weapons scattered throughout the roads and clenched in the dead’s hands. To this day, the Guardian remains unnamed for fear that if they were to learn it and speak it out loud it would summon the monster to every Seph home. </p>

                            <p>The camp that the Sephs set up on the other side of the Gateway was delicate and attempted not to disturb any of the trees or vegetation that littered the floating mountainside. No one knew how long the journey to the other side of the Gateway would take and they needed to take stock of their losses. As’heme fell to the ground with exhaustion as he unloaded his pack. He eased his sword from his belt and set it beside him. His muscles ached as he laid his head down on the dirt. The journey over the bridge took half of the day and took the lives of over half of the ligation. It was determined that they would stay there through the night as the priests and acolytes set up vigils and a continuous prayer chant to beseech Aelia to bring peace to their dead and to the success of their pilgrimage. </p>

                            <p>The night went by without so much as a insect bite or animal cry. In fact, no one even noticed that they couldn’t hear the raging torrents of the Maelstrom below.  It was deadly quiet. An omen that should have been noticed. As the day dawned the following morning, the morale of the Sephs was brighter, the people woke up refreshed, lighter then they had felt in a long time. The euphoria of still being alive was a sign to them that Aelia had heard their prayers. Surely the Goddess would hear their pleas and deliver them victory in the Campaign and salvation from the famine that would surely sweep their cities if they were to lose. The sun shined a brilliant hue of golden warmth past the twin satellites that hung low in the dawning sky. After a light meal, the pilgrimage set out into the Guardian’s vast floating island. </p>

                            <p>As’heme once again fell to the rear of the caravan, behind the priests envoy. He would listen to the conversations, rather the sermons that the clergy of Aelia would preach at the top of each hour. He mostly tried to drown out their ramblings with the scenery of the Guardian’s magnificent vistas. The island was a wonder of the Goddess herself, but each time the priests started anew, he would have flashbacks to his youth and the endless lectures he heard from the elders of the church. This hour’s reciting was the parable of The Gift. A story that As’heme had learned well as it appealed to his sense of apathetic sarcasm that shaped most of his interactions. As his thoughts were drifting away from himself he suddenly was jerked back to the present by a stop in the priest’s sermon. The whole ligation had come to a stop in the middle of a large shallow valley of tall grass and fields of vibrant flowers of hundreds of different colors. The landscape itself demanded attention, but they hadn’t expected a stop for another two hours. There were murmurs and speculation that the head of the ligation had found an artifact or shrine to Aelia. As the minutes continued and the pilgrimage was held at a standstill more speculation spread through the camps. </p>

                            <p>As’heme shifted his weight and adjusted his rucksack on his shoulder. His patience like the rest was starting to waver. Then he saw Ni’himer walking down the ranks of Seph to stand by As’heme. A stern and sober expression was stapled across the stout warrior. As’heme let the silence surround the two men, letting him make the first move. After a few minutes Ni’himer finally spoke. “Doesn’t something strike you as strange?”</p>

                            <p>Of course As’heme had the same thoughts, but he wasn’t going to let him know of his trepidation. “Yeah, we are standing around when we should be walking.” The pithy and sarcastic comment rolled off of Ni’himer without so much of a smirk. His gaze was still surveying the land. </p>

                            <p>“Have you seen one animal on this island?”</p>

                            <p>“What?” </p>

                            <p>“An animal As’heme. Or any other living thing for that matter?”</p>

                            <p>“Is that why we’re stopped? Because we haven’t seen an elk running through these hills?” As’heme was more incredulous than he had meant to be. As if mocking Ni’himer as a fool. Which was not his intent. “Sorry.” He was caught off guard with the observation, and as he thought about it he realized that he had not seen a single creature since crossing the bridge. “Surely there’s been a bird flying through the air or insects roaming around? Look at these fields. Flower’s can’t just bloom like that on their own.”</p>

                            <p>“There’s an ill feeling in the air, lad. The higher ups are all worked up. The Titan has all manner of beast dwelling within his territory, but here, nothing.” </p>

                            <p>And then As’heme remembered. “The shi’bble!” Ni’himer looked at him with a confused gaze. “The shi’bble, Ni’himer. It ran beside us as we were crossing the bridge. A blank expression was all that As’heme saw.</p>

                            <p>“Lad, I’ve not seen any such animal since we left the last village.” </p>

                            <p>“Right, I mean it wasn’t an actual shi’bble,  the small rodent that was by my feet when we got to the last cliff before the bridge. When we first saw the island. Ni’himer, you are the one that pointed it out to me. You joked that it was my pet.”</p>

                            <p>“As’heme, I didn’t say any such thing, or see any such creature.”</p>

                            <p>“I swear to you that happened. I even saw it again that night before we traveled across the bridge. It’s a small creature, only a boot length high, strange markings on its body. Short ear lobes that come to a point. A pointed face. Nothing?”</p>

                            <p>Ni’himer just shook his head. Frustrated how he could just forget something that unusual, As’heme gave out a exasperated breath and turned to look over the meadow. After a few seconds of trying to gather his thoughts something caught his attention. A few hundred meters across the field of grass and flowers, atop of a large rock a tiny creature propped its pointed ears up, turned its head and looked at As’heme.</p>

                            <p>“There!” As’heme yelled and pointed at the shi’bble doppelgänger. “It’s right-“ but before he could finish there was a loud and blood curdling cry that came from the caravan. Both men’s attention snapped their heads around to see one of their own soldiers screaming at the top of his lungs. His giant broadsword raised high in the air came crashing down on a priest standing nearby. The man was incensed. His eyes were locked in an intensity that shriveled As’heme’s spine. Chaos erupted in the ranks of the camps. Acolytes and priests ran for there lives as soldiers tried to grapple with their homicidal brother attempting to disarm him and restore order. The crazed soldier was not allowing his rage to be dismissed. He threw off two men and swung his sword around again striking a soldier of small stature in the shoulder. As the blade was raised back out, the young Seph feel to the ground as his arm was hanging off by muscle and tendons.</p>

                            <p>Ni’himer rushed towards the melee forty meters away. Two swords now were impaled into the berserker Seph, but his fury cries were still echoing off the hills and mountains in the distance. As’heme looked away as the gruesome sight was drawing to its final minutes. The shi’bble still had its gaze fixated on As’heme. From the grass he saw another shi’bble stick its head above the grass. It had different coloring and markings from the one As’heme saw before. Its gazed pointed towards one of the priests standing in front of him. He watched as the priest stumbled on his feet for a moment. Then standing up he began yelling that Aelia had forsaken all Seph and that they were all doomed to die here. He took a flask of oil from his pack and doused his robes in the flammable liquid. Taking a flint and striker in his hand everyone looked in horrific shock as he set himself on fire. </p>

                            <p>As’heme stepped back from the priest engulfed in flames. As more people rushed to put out the fire As’heme saw more shi’bble arise from the grass in all directions they sat up and stared at the pilgrimage. Hundreds of them all with different colored fur, different markings, different sizes watched as one after another Seph after Seph fell into various forms of homicidal and suicidal insanity until the entire contingent of soldiers, priests, and acolytes were tearing into each other. Ripping flesh and bone away with sword, mace, and their bare hands while others were impaling themselves upon spears and smashing their own heads against the rocks that littered the landscape.</p>

                            <p>As’heme was helpless. His legs were like stone melded with the earth. He could not look away from the horror that was befalling all his kinsmen. In absence of words, tears rolled down his face. Some force was compelling him to watch.</p>

                            <p>As the carnage was coming to its finale, Ni’himer stood in front of As’heme. Blood splattered across his whole body. Some of it his own. Most from other Sephs. His breathing was heavy and his eyes were glazed over. Rage and anger were the only emotions that As’heme could see in his former friend. Ni’himer said nothing, only raised his sword and waited. As’heme still could not move. He tired to fight through his paralysis and take out his sword, but it was futile. He body was not under his own control. The sword would soon drop and As’heme would feel the release of death. </p>

                            <p>And he thought that wouldn’t be so bad.</p>

                            <p>Ni’himer’s eyes flashed and he began to swing his sword down onto As’heme. Then as if someone had stopped him, his body stiffened and fell limp. Ni’himer collapsed to the ground with a heavy thud. All As’heme could do was watch as his friend gasped for his last breath and then lay motionless.</p>

                            <p>Standing behind Ni’himer as he fell was the shi’bble As’heme had seen before. It’s fur was white with strange reddish markings that now resembled words of old Aelian text. As’heme recognized the symbol as meaning compassion. It looked up at As’heme. For an unending minute the two stared at one another. When As’heme looked up, he saw all of the shi’bble encircling him. Each of the hundreds of small creatures looked at him with a different expression. All had different coloring and different characters. Some he recognized as anger, madness, hysteria, and some were unrecognizable. The longer he looked at the characters, the more he could have guessed what they meant. </p>

                            <p>The white shi’bble with the red markings then stood up on its hind legs, and from somewhere deep within his mind, As’heme heard a terrible and powerful voice speak to him.</p>

                            <p>“We are the Guardians of Aelia. We are the extension of her magnificence. We protect her grace and beauty from the depravity this world has become. Aelia had given you paradise, but you have squandered your place by her side. Now you will feel your place underneath her feet. We are her vengeance and her benevolence. We are the Min’eros!”</p>

                            <p>Then all hundred voices echoed in a deafening roar in As’heme’s head.</p>

                            <p>“Your life has been spared to return to your people. To tell them that death awaits them if they dare to desecrate our lands again with their presence.” </p>

                            <p>“But first, you have another task to complete.”</p>

                            <p>...</p>

                            <p>Five years passed through the world. The Sephs lost control of their settlements along the Titan Fields. Famine and death swept through the Contingent as the aftermath of the 58th Campaign befell the vanquished.</p>

                            <p>In a small village on the northeastern coast of the Seph territories then inhabitants went about their daily chores with the same downtrodden reserve that had been a staple of their lives for the last half decade. It was on this day five years back where they played host to the pilgrimage that set out to save them from the Aelian aggressors.</p>

                            <p>At the edge of the village, tending a small garden, a young woman worked the rocky soil. Tilling the dirt over and over trying to coax the nutrients of the land to grow a new crop of vegetables. Looking up towards the eastern cliffs she saw a vision of a man hobbling over the stony hill. He stood uneasily when he reached the top, swayed with the wind, then collapsed.</p>

                            <p>Each moment when he regained consciousness was agony. The villagers had brought him to the healer’s hut. Anointed with salves and other medicinal remedies the man struggled to speak. Hearing only scattered words and phrases, he gathered that they had pieced together his story.</p>

                            <p>“Look at his clothing.</p>

                            <p>“The are the marks of the Seph Contingent.”</p>

                            <p>“He was a soldier in the 58th Campaign.”</p>

                            <p>“What was he doing out on the eastern shoreline?”</p>

                            <p>“Was he in the pilgrimage?”</p>

                            <p>The man gasped in agony as he tried to speak, “As’heme. My...name.” The villagers were asking so many questions that As’heme couldn’t keep track of any of it. Nor did he care to. His body was beyond exhausted. His limbs felt as if they had already fallen off of his body. Crushing pain engulfed him with every breath he took. He wanted to tell them what had happened to him. The warning and the price he had paid for his people’s arrogance that Aelia would have headed their prayers or pleas for help. But the only words he was able to whisper were, “The....Guardian...Min’eros...killed everyone. Never...go...back.”</p>

                            <p>As’heme took his last breath in that hut as death finally eased his torture.</p>

                            <p>For five long years, The Min’eros forced As’heme to drag each body from the valley to the edge of their island and throw it into the Maelstrom below. The Guardians would not allow the bodies of the Seph to defile their divine lands. Each day As’heme would pull the corpse of a Seph over hill and mountain. And each day, he would hear the thoughts and relive the last excruciating moments of the man’s life. For that was the true frightening power of the Min’eros.</p>

							<p>Every day for five years, the small white Min’eros with the red markings would walk along side of As’heme showing him the lives of those that he dragged behind him. Every day, without rest until his task was completed.</p>
