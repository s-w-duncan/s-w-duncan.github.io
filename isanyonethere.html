                            <p>The shadows slowly crept up the west side of a run down fifteen story brownstone building. Like invaders, the shadows spread out against the worn bricks, devouring the red and brown hues leaving darkness behind in their wake. Black soot emanated from the darkness eager to breath in the night's breath. Inside the building, signs of life began to pop out sporadically from the windows stained and warped from time's gentle fury. Rays of artificial light started to penetrate through the air between buildings of the dying metropolitan slums outside. This only fueled the shadows to grow stronger around the false suns.  Dancing on the edges of the beams they warped the reality around them and created their own tapestries in the blackness.</p>

                            <p>Oblivious to the subtlety of the orchestra of darkness surrounding them, the inhabitants went along with their everyday tasks and preparations. Each window portrayed a different story of what kind of life was being played out within its confines.  Most drew on the mundane and ordinary.</p>
                            
                            <p>High above those seedy streets though, on the corner of the thirteenth story, one window never stirred away from the shadows. It invited them in with open arms. It reveled in the darkness of the chaos. A solitary metal lamp absent from all other windows on the building hung against the bricks just outside the window. Inside that window stood wooden walls once made from strong trees. Below those walls lay cold unforgiving concrete floors.  And atop the floors scattered about remnants of a time lost to everyone around this room.</p>

                            <p>The room was from another time and a place few visited or even knew about. Secrets and lies that could topple governments with their uttering once whispered through its corridors. Now silence settled around the room, for there was no doorway that entry could be granted. The last exodus sealed away the room to hide its nature from the world. It's purpose delegated to harbor relics from an era past.</p>

                            <p>The few pieces of furniture left felt abandoned. Their structures splintered and fittings loosen by the restriction and expansion of wooden frames against the pain of summer's humidity and the sting of winter's grasp. One solitary picture hung ragged on the wall. A canvas once oiled with magnificent colors forming the skyline of the metropolis, now as faded as the city itself. A small wooden bead was missing from the frame of the picture. In days forgotten, inserting the correct key into the missing slot would cause the mechanism from behind the frame to actuate and the metal plaque beneath the frame would spring open on its hinges to uncover a secret cache of money and documents. The plaque read, "to all good endeavors..."</p>

                            <p>Suddenly a large boom echoed through the room. Dust rained down from the ceiling and walls. Silence. Then another large shake and a sound like the deafening roar of a startled sleeping giant erupted from the confines of the room at the end of the thirteenth floor atop the city sky. The room was awaking from its long stationed hibernation. Life was about to be created from the darkness once more. One more thunderous upheaval and the room gave way to the light. Breaking through a section of the wall, a strong luminous beam from a hidden hallway that ran across more secret compartments of the brownstone shed brightly into the long darkened chamber.</p>

                            <p>ALooking back out to the window a small metal switch protruded from the wall. A seemingly insignificant switch, but it's meaning changed the course and nature of a life every time it was used. A simple light switch to a metal lamp hanging outside of its window. A signal. The light was on once again thirteen stories high on the corner of a brownstone building in the slums of a dying metropolis.</p>
