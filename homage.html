								<h2>The Anatomy of a Galaxy</h2>
                            </header>
                            <p>There have been many stories told of the origins of the galaxy over the course of time. More stories than one can count. No one knows which one is true. Perhaps pieces of each story hold their own truths. That is why a large population of the galaxy have come to refer to their home in the great universe as Hom'age.</p>
							<p>One such story involved a conflict called The Old War. Much of what is known about this era has been unearthed in the ruins of three satalite planetoids that orbit a gigantic gas giant on the border of galatic center. Findings on these planets point to a battle between the moons inhabitants and a mammoth galactic being that seeded life on the cosmos as their fight raged on. </p>
							<p>Hom'age is divided into three great sectors of planets and stars. The three Vitale Armes extended from the center of the galaxy. These spiral sections of the galaxy saw the only concentrated grouping of habitable solar systems. When humanity began its exodus into the stars, little was known of what lay outside their own small fraction of the galaxy. It was a time of adventure and exploration into the great unknown. The first Vitale Arme became known as, Hearth.</p>
							<p>Outside of the Vitale Armes, habitable planets were a near impossibility. Closer to the point, none have yet to be encountered, nor have any stars or other spacial matter. Few artificial colonies have been attempted throughout the years in the barren void between Vitale Arms, but the cost and resources needed to maintain a large scale colony soon overcame the novelty of a base in the middle of dead space.</p>
							<p>Explorers, at great, cost finally charted a path through the dead space which became known as the Starless Span. Expansion into the second Vitale Arme erupted like wild fire. Separatists eager to establish their own colonies far outside the reach of the empirical human government spurred a quick and violent migration. Constant colonial wars sparked and fizzled through the early years of settlement. This ceased only when alliances between colonies were finally established under the motivating force of self-preservation. Soon each alliance began to absorb the cultures of those that lived within. Patchwork governments were established to not only safeguard themselves against other alliances but to halt the Order of the Aegis from gaining more foothold within the Arme. Ambition and malice festered within the Order's leadership. War erupted between the Order and the fletchling governments of the second Vitale Arme. Banding together these governments becames known as the Union. Through the resulting Union War, the coalition of governments were able to push back the OA's advances, and secured for themselves a permanent home within the Vitale Arme which they named, Haven.</p>
							<p>It was not soon after the war ended that dormant issues which were subdued by the Union War reignited between each governmental nation. The Union still stood as a safeguard to the Order's intrusions into their affairs, but each of the star nations began to retreat into zenophobic policies and ceased communications between other nations save only to coordinate Union patrols of Aegis activities in Haven.</p>
							<p>After the humiliating defeat at the hands of seperatist nations, there began a civil dissent amongst the Order and its population throughout Hearth. Assasinations and cival wars ran rampant during this time until a prevailing and unifying body came to power in the chaos. The Aegis Assembly was formed from visonary leaders throughout the Order. Rallied around a common ideology, the Assembly reformed the Order of the Aegis into a more tolerant force within the galaxy.</p>
							<p>Upon the formation of the new Aegis Assembly, a central omphalos was created to house the government. A city station was constructed inside the outer atmosphere of the gas giant surrounded by the ruined planets of the Old War. This ambitious undertaking, named Aegis Prime was to symbolize the new direction of the Order and the decimated planets a representation of the follies of tryanical reign.   </p>
							<p>Sadly, not all lessons are remembered for long...</p>
