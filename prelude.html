								<h2>Rest Of The Last Sol</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I have experienced the noble pursuit of justice, I have felt the pain of loss, and I have felt the need for horrifying vengeance. But never would I have imagined my life would come this far. To the extremes of human thought and the very fabric of creation. I look out upon my station and see the starlight dawning across the cosmos. </p>

                            <p>I had once thought life was as simple as a single path, a choice leading to another, leading to another. What I have done, what I am doing, what I will come to do all has transcended any understanding of morality or reality that I came to know when I started on my peregrination.</p>
                            
                            <p>I have seen the universe burn bright with the tortured agony of every being that has ever felt joy and terror and pain. And I have been at the cause of it all.</p>

                            <p>Excogitate these words with solemn care.</p>

                            <p>You know strife and suffering like few before you. You have stared down the eyes of devils and demons. You have seen the heartbreak and degradation of your world; you have seen your world burn. You think that nothing can ever bring you closer to the hopelessness of your own broken soul, your chance for redemption a myth. You are wrong.</p>

                            <p>See the faces of those you knew and loved in your life. Remember them well and honor their lives; for they will save you in ways unimaginable. You are not dead. Remember that perhaps most of all. You are alive more than any being out in the great ocean of star and rock. Those that came before you all have fallen to the darkness, but their sacrifice has abated the complete destruction of the ephemeral paradise. A spark stills remains that threatens to be extinguished. </p>

                            <p>The trials that you now undertake will have no words to describe them, no emotions that can possibly make you understand what is at stake if you fail. Simply put; countless worlds will ignite and burn for an unending millennia if you fall. Those that you love, those that you would ever come to love, will lose hope, will lose all sense of righteousness and goodness, will become the very demons that they've fought so hard to banish. You must turn their lives back from the brink of oblivion and eternal torment.</p>

                            <p>Go back to the beginning; to where your peregrination started, to why you took up your weapon and defended what was just. In this instant, purity and innocence were your strength and salvation. Carry them with you, as they helped you then, they will save you once more in solace.</p>

                            <p>You know what it is to sacrifice. You've given your very life to fight for a belief of an ideal that is better than what your eyes can see. You yet live! And you are not finished. Take up your charge. Set your eyes to the dark horizon. All of the Heavens and all of the Hells in the universe will rise up to swallow you, to tear apart your soul. Fight the flood of overwhelming oppression and rage.  Do not fall to the sands of times forever gone.</p>
