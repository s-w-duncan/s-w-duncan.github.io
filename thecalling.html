							<p>“Nu diraem vago ie sanctium,” steady brother, not much farther now. The native language of the Nairu echoed along the cavern walls. Two figures took slow and resigned steps further into the darkness. They were wrapped in dark cloth and covered in a cloak that reached down to their knees. One braced himself against the other, not able to hold his own weight upon his long and lithe frame. Buried deep within the world the two men limped further into the underground depths of the Desecrated Lands. </p>

                            <p>Heading towards a fate uncertain their only guide was the voice screaming within the mind of the hobbled Nairu, “MO’OR ORI”, come to me. </p>
                            
                            <p>Further within the caverns below the scorched earth of the plains of the Desecrated Lands, the voice intensified causing the Nairu to fall to his knees clutching his oblong shaped head.</p>

                            <p>“Make it stop, Frere!” The man now clawed at his skull, trying to pry out the words of the invader within his mind. His companion crouched down grabbing his hands and holding him down. “I can’t take it anymore. Take your knife and finish it!”</p>

                            <p>“Be calm, Ciel.” The companion was whispering in Ciel’s ear. “It will soon subside. We can stay here for a bit, I don’t believe any beasts nearby. Rest and focus your mind.”</p>

                            <p>“It’s so loud...” Ciel quietly wept against his friend’s body.</p>

                            <p>A quarter rotation of the planet’s moon passed. Ciel’s protector was perched on a rock some twenty paces in front of his friend who had fitfully fallen asleep. Ciel thrashed randomly against the damp cavern walls. The Nairu feared the visions that were pouring through Ciel’s consciousness. Worried that his screams would awake the creatures that laid dormant in the caverns, or the gigantic beasts that roamed the wastelands on the surface only dozens of meters overhead. The able bodied Nairu had always been a pusillanimous being, finding risk and exigency behind every corner. It made him a natural outsider to his race. It was with Ciel that he had a true friend and comrade. So when the voice began speaking to Ciel, the Nairu felt there was no other choice than to help Ciel see his friend through to the end.</p>

                            <p>“Frere?” </p>

                            <p>“I’m here my friend. Are you able to stand?”</p>

                            <p>“Yes, I think. The sonance has calmed for now.”</p>

                            <p>“I’ve scouted a few hundred meters ahead, there are no signs of any tunnels diverging up to the surface. For now, we are going deeper into the earth.” The Nairu helped Ciel up to his feet. He looked in the fatigued and sanguine eyes of the only Nairu that he loved. Within his chest his hearts sank as the empathy of his friend’s pain was felt. “Are you sure it is telling you this is the way?” Ciel only nodded. Without another word parsed between the two, they continued their march down into the viscera of the expanse’s caverns.</p>

                            <p>Deftly the pair took step after step through the suffocating darkness. The wraps that bounded their feet dispersed the sound of their steps. Nairu were a cautious species. Although they stood more than 3 meters tall they were the among the smallest creatures that inhabited the world. Pale grey skin, orbs that glowed a gentle blue inset within their eye sockets portrayed a vast spectrum of emotions by the subtle changes in color. The only sounds that came through the spiraling tunnels were the erratic drips of water falling from the ceiling of the cavern. Ciel thought that it might be raining no the surface. He let his mind drift to thoughts of his homestead far on the other side of the world to a time where he use to sit out on an outcropping of rock and grass gazing out on the vast ocean and to the continent beyond. A continent rife with gigantic beasts and torrent storms that scared the land. The very continent he now found himself on, following a voice that he did not recognized but feared.</p>

                            <p>A loud cry pierced the silence. It stopped Ciel and his companion cold in their stride. For an instant, all they could do was look at one another in horror, knowing that whatever this beast was would gut their insides with ease. Another cry, more guttural this time. it was coming closer. The echo of the cavern made it impossible to know exactly how far the creature was from their location. With all haste that he dared, Ciel’s companion helped him to a corner of the cave were a jagged rock jutted out from the wall. It gave the two the smallest of cover. He placed Ciel within the crevasse and stood directly in front of him. Without sound, he reached up to the hood of his cloak and took a piece of fabric from one side and attached it to the other. The cloth covered his eyes and blotted out the light that they emitted. Ciel did the same and there they stood, waiting for death to take them. </p>

                            <p>Each second they stood there felt interminable. An agony of knowing that you will die prolonged each moment into an eternity. Out of the silence, between each moan of the animal, came a growing rhythmic beating against the earth. Footstep after footstep reverberated off the walls of the pitch black cave.  The two dared not to breathe, dared not to move. They felt themselves melting into the rock face of the cavern walls. If they could summon the magic, then would turn themselves into stone. The sound was all around them now. Gigantic footsteps echoed in their head. Wailing screeches split their thoughts. A fear paralyzed the two. Then came a belch of air that filled their nostrils sickening them with a wave of nausea that filled up to their throats.</p>

                            <p>Then there was silence. The moment continued on through eternity. This was the moment that they would die. They would feel their flesh being ripped from their bodies, their organs exposed to the damp air of the cave. They would hear the creature feasting on their internal organs before finally succumbing to the final rest. Part of that thought made Ciel yearn for the release of death. Perhaps then he would find peace from the voice that resided within his mind. There was a fraction of a moment that Ciel was ready to shout at the top of his lungs and lunge at the beast giving himself to it. But the fear kept him a statue, glued to listening for the slightest noise that would mark the beginning of the feast. </p>

                            <p>The beast was there. Ciel could stretch out his hand and touch the animal’s razor sharp hide. With a jerk of its head, it sniffed the air. Something was there. Something that stunk of meat. The instincts of the animal took over. It was ready to feed.</p>

                            <p>Frere was ready to act. His hand deafly slipped the sword an inch out of its scabbard. The beast was going to attack. He would be dead within an instant and never again see his home. Then time froze. The beast caught their scent. Frere pulled his sword free of its sheath. Ciel was crumbling down to the floor. And the beast ran. It ran down the dark corridor of the tunnel. It was running for its very life. The squeals coming from its body were of pure horror.</p>

                            <p>The Nairu both stood frozen for minutes. Neither wanting to move in case they had hallucinated what had just happened. Surely the beast was still there and was waiting for them to move in order to devour their flesh. If not that beast, then one more terrifying was coming to finish where the other left off. After each minute past and they were still there, unharmed, still breathing the cool damp air of the cavern, Frere finally dropped his arm and returned his sword back into its cloth. </p>

                            <p>“What just happened, Ciel?” Frere was still in shock and in disbelief. He was ready to greet the afterlife, and his ancestors that came before him. </p>

                            <p>“I do not know, old friend.” Ciel turned to his companion. “But I believe that we are here.”</p>

                            <p>“What-“ Before he could finish there was a loud rumbling force that was emanating from beneath their feet. The shockwave grew exponentially. The entire cavern shook with a force that neither Nairu had ever felt before. The ground beneath their feet opened up and swallowed them. </p>

                            <p>Frere and Ciel slid along the falling rocks and dirt further beneath the land. They fell deeper and deeper into the world than they felt was possible. Finally they broke through the ceiling of gigantic chasm in the world. The free fall felt as if they were flying through the ether of existence. It was terrifying, but it was exhilarating.</p>

                            <p>The two crashed into the ground. Agony washed over their bodies. Bones were shattered, for that Frere was certain. He could not move his legs nor his sword arm. Every nerve in his body fired with pain. </p>

                            <p>“Ciel. Ciel are you alive? I can’t move.” Frere’s voice was frantic, barely comprehendible.</p>

                            <p>“I’m here, Frere.” The voice was calm, cold and distant. There was a moment’s thought from Frere that the voice didn’t sound like his friend’s, but rather a voice from another world. “And I know what it all means now.”</p>

                            <p>Frere’s head was almost buried in the dirt. He could hear Ciel’s words behind him but he could not turn his body to see him. “Ciel, are you okay? Can you move?” His questions were only met with silence. He heard the rocks of the dirt shift, heard Ciel rise to his feet. “Ciel?”</p>

                            <p>“MO’OR ORI!”</p>

                            <p>Frere’s ears shattered with the booming voice. His head felt as if it was exploding from the inside by the words bellowing through his skull. Words that he could not understand. Words that he could only imagine meant the end of the world and all existence. Then out of the corner of his eye, Frere saw the cloth wrapped boot of Ciel walk past. “Ciel…”</p>

                            <p>“Peace now, brother. He has come to ease our pain.”</p>

                            <p>“Ciel, please. Help me.”</p>

                            <p>“He is glory.”</p>

                            <p>“Ciel! Can you hear me?”</p>

                            <p>“He is life.” </p>

                            <p>“CIEL!”</p>

                            <p>“I am here. Speak to me. Command me.”</p>

                            <p>Frere tried to force out another plea, but none would come. He felt the heavy weight of despair fall on his soul. His fingers grasp at the rock and dirt underneath his hand. He tried to fight through pain of the broken bones and injured organs. Still, his body failed him. </p>

                            <p>“MO’OR ORI!”</p>

                            <p>“Yes.” </p>

                            <p>“MO’OR ORI!”</p>

                            <p>“Yes.”</p>

                            <p>The repetition became a chant between Ciel and the Voice. A death march inside Frere’s head. And just as Frere felt the last remaining consciousness slip from his mind, it stopped. There was a deathly silence until he heard a voice whisper in his ear.</p>

                            <p>“He is ready for you now, brother.” Ciel knelt close to his companion. More than that, a brother and the best Nairu he had ever known.</p>

                            <p>“Ciel…” Frere’s voice trailed off. He noticed a change in Ciel. No longer was his voice timid and unsure, but now there was a assured certainty behind his words. A grim power that seeped from each inflection.</p>

                            <p>Ciel rose to his feet and turned his speech to a far off presence. “I give you this offering. Take him and together I will follow you to Pantheon.”</p>

                            <p>Frere felt his spine chill, the air sucked from his lungs. No more did he feel despair. It was replaced by a horror unknown to any Nairu since the dawn of the second age. He felt his body stiffen. All sensation of movement left, but the feeling of pain remained and it was all Frere could feel. He felt the icy touch of an enormous hand surround his entire body. The hand was not one of corporeal form. Yet, Frere was lifted off of the ground. His body constricting in agony. His screams filled the cavern. His eyes opened wide. The entity slowly turned Frere around.</p>

                            <p>Frere first saw his friend. He no longer stood with a limp. His back was not hunched crooked wracked with pain. He stood erect, with purpose. Ciel’s back was to Frere yet he could feel his friend’s gaze upon him. Ciel turned to face his companion. His eyes did not emit a soft blue glow as all Nairu’s did, but now in its place was a black void seeping out of his eyes penetrating Frere’s soul. “Behold his radiance, brother!”</p>

                            <p>Frere’s eyes traced up the cavern’s walls. Half encased within the rocky surface was a figure that Frere had only seen in nightmares. The monster stretched thirty meters tall. It’s legs, torso, arms all deformed in a twisted mixture of flesh and metal. Each segment of its body appeared hollow, as if only the casing of a piece of armor was all the creature was constructed of. Then a single eye flashed a brilliant blinding red light out across the darkness of the cave. The creature’s eye seemed to burn with a white hot fire that pierce through the soul.</p>

                            <p>Then began the roar of the beast. It started as a low rumbling verse, the cavern began to tremble under its malice. Dust and rock fell from the walls as the shaking became more violent. The entire system of tunnels within the earth echoed the monster’s song as it grew in strength. Frere wanted desperately to rip out his ears. As much as he tried, he could not move his body from the creature’s ineffable hold. Only his mouth was free to scream out the pain within his mind joining with the monster’s cries.</p>

                            <p>“Behold the rebirth of the Neu’Rennan!” Ciel’s voice joined the twisted chorus. The creature flexed its mighty arm and broke the earth and rock holding it hostage. One by one each of its appendages bursted free and there, standing before the Nairu was the unholy abomination that had been calling out to the world for someone to unleash it back onto the world.</p>

                            <p>Reaching out it’s taloned hand the Neu’Rennan grasp Frere and began to squeeze. </p>

                            <p>Frere felt his bones crack and shatter. Before he lost all life from his body he looked down one final time to see his brother. The man he had loved the most in the world. Ciel was wrapped in the ecstasy of the creature’s malevolence. A smile was on his face when death’s darkness descended.</p>
